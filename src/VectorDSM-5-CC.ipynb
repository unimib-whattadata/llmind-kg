         "Catherine Lord, Ph.D.  Ashley, age 17, was referred for a diagnostic reevaluation after having carried diagnoses of autism and intellectual disability for almost all of her life. She was recently found to have Kleefstra syndrome, and the family wanted to reconfirm the earlier diagnoses and assess the genetic risk to the future children of her older sisters. At the time of the reevaluation, Ashley was attending a special school with a focus on functional skills. She was able to dress herself, but she was not able to shower independently or be left alone in the house. She was able to decode (e.g., read words) and spell at a second-grade level but understood little of what she read. Changes to her schedule and heightened functional expectations tended to make her irritable. When upset, Ashley would often hurt herself (e.g., biting her wrist) and others (e.g., pinching and hair pulling). In formal testing done at the time of the reevaluation, Ashley had a nonverbal IQ of 39 and a verbal IQ of 23, with a full scale IQ of 31. Her adaptive scores were somewhat higher, with an overall score of 42 (with 100 as average). By history, Ashley first received services at age 9 months after her parents noticed significant motor delays. She walked at 20 months and was toilet trained at 5 years. She  spoke her first word at age 6. She received a diagnosis of developmental delay at age 3 and of autism, obesity, and static encephalopathy at age 4. An early evaluation noted possible facial dysmorphology; genetic tests at that time were noncontributory. Her parents indicated that Ashley knew hundreds of single words and many simple phrases. She had long been very interested in license plates and would draw them for hours. Her strongest skill was memory, and she could draw precise representations of license plates from different states. Ashley had always been very attached to her parents and sisters, and although affectionate toward babies, she showed minimal interest in other teenagers. Ashley's family history was pertinent for a father with dyslexia, a paternal uncle with epilepsy, and a maternal male cousin with possible \"Asperger's syndrome.\" Her siblings, both sisters, were in college and doing well. On examination, Ashley was an overweight young woman who made inconsistent eye contact but often peered out the corner of her eye. She had a beautiful smile and would sometimes laugh to herself, but most of the time her facial expressions were subdued. She did not initiate joint attention by trying to catch another person's eyes. She frequently ignored what others would say to her. To request a preferred object (e.g., a shiny magazine), Ashley would rock from foot to foot and point. When offered an object (e.g., a small decorated box), she brought it to her nose and lips for inspection. Ashley spoke in a high-pitched voice with unusual intonation. During the interview, she used multiple words and a few short phrases that were somewhat rote but communicative, such as \"I want to clean up,\" and \"Do you have a van?\"  In the months prior to the evaluation, Ashley's parents noticed that she had become increasingly apathetic. A medical evaluation concluded that urinary tract infections were the most likely cause for her symptoms, but antibiotics seemed only to make her more listless. Further medical evaluation led to more extensive genetic testing, and Ashley was diagnosed with Kleefstra syndrome, a rare genetic defect associated with multiple medical problems, including intellectual developmental disorder. The parents said they were also tested and found to \"be negative.\" The parents specifically wanted to know whether the genetic testing results affected  Ashley's long-standing diagnoses and access to future services. Furthermore, they wanted to know whether their other two daughters should get tested for their risk of carrying genes for autism, intellectual disability, and/or Kleefstra syndrome.",
         "Discussion In regard to diagnosis, Ashley's cognitive testing and limited everyday adaptive skills are consistent with intellectual developmental disorder, a term in DSM-5-TR that is equivalent to \"intellectual disability,\" which had previously been the preferred term. In addition, Ashley manifests two symptom clusters that are core to the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD): 1) deficits in social communication and 2) restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities. Ashley also fulfills the DSM-5-TR ASD requirement of having had symptoms in the early developmental period and a history of significant impairment. A fifth requirement for ASD is that the disturbances are not better explained by intellectual developmental disorder, which is a more complicated question in Ashley's case.  For many years, clinicians and researchers have debated the boundary between ASD and intellectual developmental disorders. As IQ decreases, the proportion of children and adults who meet criteria for ASD increases. Most individuals with IQs below 30 have ASD as well as intellectual developmental disorder. For Ashley to meet DSM-5-TR criteria for both ASD and intellectual developmental disorder, the specific deficits and behaviors associated with ASD must be greater than what would ordinarily be seen in people with her overall intellectual development. In other words, if her deficits were due solely to limited intellectual abilities, she would be expected to have the social and play skills of a typical 3- to 4-year-old child. Ashley's social interaction is not at all like that of a typical preschooler, however, and never has been. She has limited facial expressions, poor eye contact, and minimal interest in peers. In comparison with her \"mental age,\" Ashley demonstrates significant restriction in both her range of interests and her understanding of basic human emotions. Furthermore, she manifests behaviors that are not seen commonly at any age.  The heterogeneity of autism has led to significant conflict. Some argue, for example, that children with very severe intellectual developmental disorder should be excluded from  the diagnosis of ASD. Others argue that more intellectually able children with ASD should be placed into their own category, Asperger syndrome. Research does not support either of these distinctions. For example, studies indicate that children with ASD symptoms and severe intellectual developmental disorder often have siblings with ASD and stronger intellectual abilities. Much remains to be known about ASD, but IQ does not appear to be the key distinguishing factor. From a pragmatic perspective, the critical factor is whether an ASD diagnosis offers information that helps guide treatment and the availability of services. For Ashley, the ASD diagnosis encourages a focus on helping to support her in social skills and less structured environments. It calls attention to differences in her motivation and in her need for structure. The ASD diagnosis also underlines the importance of looking carefully for Ashley's cognitive strengths (e.g., rote memory and visual representation) and weaknesses (e.g., comprehension, social interaction, and an ability to adapt to change). All of these may play a large role in her efforts to live as independently as possible.  Ashley's parents are also concerned about the impact of the recent genetic testing results on Ashley's treatment and on her sisters' family planning. Hundreds of individual genes may play a role in the complex neurological issues involved in autism, but most cases of ASD lack a clear cause. Ashley's genetic condition, Kleefstra syndrome, is reliably associated with both intellectual developmental disorder and ASD symptoms. When a genetic or medical condition or environmental factor appears to be implicated, it is listed as a specifier, but the ASD diagnosis is not otherwise affected. Knowledge of the genetic cause for Ashley's intellectual developmental disorder and ASD is important for several reasons. It reminds her physicians to look for medical comorbidities that are common in Kleefstra syndrome, such as problems with the heart and kidneys (possibly leading, for example, to her recurrent urinary tract infections). Knowledge of the genetic cause also expands informational resources by connecting Ashley's family to other families that are affected by this rare syndrome. A particularly important aspect of this new genetic diagnosis is its effect on Ashley's sisters. In almost all reported cases, Kleefstra syndrome has occurred de novo, meaning  that there is an extremely low likelihood that anyone else in her family has any abnormality in the affected gene region. On rare occasions, an unaffected parent has a chromosomal translocation or mosaicism that leads to the syndrome, but the fact that Ashley's parents were found to \"be negative\" implies they are not genetic carriers. Although this is not necessarily true for situations involving other autism-related genetic disorders, this particular genetic diagnosis in Ashley likely indicates that her sisters are not at greatly increased risk for having children with ASD, although they are not protected from ordinary risk. Such information can be very reassuring and useful to Ashley's sisters. The fact remains that although genetics undoubtedly plays a large role in ASD and intellectual developmental disorders, most cases cannot be reliably predicted, and diagnosis is made through ongoing, longitudinal observation during childhood.",

         "The authors would like to thank Arshya Vahabzadeh, M.D., for his contributions to an earlier edition of this case. Robyn Thom, M.D. Eugene Beresin, M.D. Christopher McDougle, M.D.  Brandon was a 12-year-old boy brought in by his mother for psychiatric evaluation for temper tantrums that seemed to be contributing to declining school performance. The mother became emotional as she reported that things had always been difficult but had become worse after Brandon entered middle school. Shortly after starting middle school, Brandon had started complaining of stomachaches on school-day mornings and was often reluctant to go to school. Brandon's sixth-grade teachers reported that he was academically capable but that he had little ability to make friends. He seemed to mistrust the intentions of classmates who tried to be nice to him but attempted to befriend others who laughingly feigned interest in the toy cars and trucks that he brought to school. The teachers noted that he often cried and rarely spoke in class. In recent months, multiple teachers had heard him screaming at other boys, generally in the hallway but sometimes in the middle of class. The teachers had not identified a cause but generally had not disciplined Brandon because they assumed he was responding to provocation. He was embarrassed about these outbursts and did not want to go to swim practice because he did not want his swim friends to ask why he'd had an outburst at school. When interviewed alone, Brandon responded with nonspontaneous mumbles when asked questions about school, classmates, and his family. When the examiner asked if he was interested in toy cars, however, Brandon lit up. He pulled several cars, trucks, and airplanes from his backpack and, while not making good eye contact, did talk at length about vehicles, using their apparently accurate names (e.g., front-end loader, B-52, Jaguar). When asked again about school, Brandon pulled out his cell phone and showed a string of text messages: \"dumbo!!!!\" \"mr stutter\"; \"LoSeR\"; \"freak!\"; \"EVERYBODY  HATES YOU.\" While the examiner read the long string of texts that Brandon had saved but apparently not previously revealed, Brandon added that other boys would whisper \"bad words\" to him in class and then scream in his ears in the hall. \"And I hate loud noises.\" He also told the examiner that he sometimes wished that he had never been born. Developmentally, Brandon spoke his first word at age 11 months and began to use short sentences by age 3. He had always been very focused on trucks, cars, and trains. According to his mother, he had always been \"very shy\" and had never had a best friend. As he has gotten older, it has become more apparent that he struggles with jokes and typical young adolescent banter because \"he takes things so literally.\" Brandon's mother had long seen this behavior as \"a little odd\" but added that it was not much different from that of Brandon's father, a successful attorney, who had similarly focused interests. Both of them were \"sticklers for routine\" who \"lacked a sense of humor.\" Brandon's mother noted that he made efforts to conceal his interest in trucks, cars, and trains outside of the home but would eagerly speak about them when encouraged. Brandon has shared with his mother that he tries to appear \"normal\" when interacting with peers at school, which is exhausting. He often feels nervous around peers and generally tries to avoid socializing.  On examination, Brandon was shy and generally nonspontaneous. He made below- average eye contact. His speech was coherent and goal directed. At times, Brandon stumbled over his words, paused excessively, and sometimes rapidly repeated words or parts of words. Brandon said he felt okay but added that he was scared of school, particularly when around other children. He appeared sad, brightening only when discussing his toy cars. He denied current suicidal thoughts or plans as well as homicidality. He denied psychotic symptoms. He was cognitively intact.",
         "Discussion Brandon presents with symptoms consistent with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). DSM-5 ASD incorporates several previously separate disorders, namely DSM-IV autistic disorder (autism), Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified. ASD is characterized by two main symptom domains: social  communication deficits and a fixated set of interests and repetitive behaviors.  It is evident that Brandon has considerable difficulty in his peer social interactions. He is unable to form friendships, does not engage in interactive play, and struggles with reading social cues. People with ASD typically find it challenging to correctly interpret the relevance of facial expressions, body language, and other nonverbal behaviors. He is humorless and \"takes things so literally.\" These symptoms meet the ASD criteria for social communication deficits. In regard to the second ASD symptom domain, Brandon has fixated interests and repetitive behaviors that cause significant distress. He seems interested in cars and trains, has little interest in anything else, and has limited insight that other children might not share his enthusiasms. He requires \"sameness,\" with distress arising if his routine is altered. Brandon meets both of the primary symptomatic criteria, therefore, for DSM-5 ASD. Brandon also stumbles over words, pauses excessively, and repeats words or parts of words. These symptoms are consistent with stuttering, which is classified as one of the DSM-5 communication disorders, namely childhood-onset fluency disorder. Typically persistent and characterized by frequent repetitions or prolongations of sounds, broken words, pauses in speech, and circumlocutions, childhood-onset fluency disorder may result in significant social, academic, and occupational dysfunction. Other DSM-5 communication disorders include difficulties in speech production (speech sound disorder), difficulty in use of spoken and written language (language disorder), and difficulty in the social uses of verbal and nonverbal communication (social [pragmatic] communication disorder). Although these difficulties are not noted in the case report, Brandon should be evaluated for each of these, because language impairments are so commonly part of ASD that they are listed as specifiers of ASD rather than as separate, comorbid diagnoses. Many individuals with ASD have comorbid anxiety symptoms. The most common anxiety disorders in ASD are specific phobia, social anxiety disorder, and agoraphobia. In Brandon's case, signs that suggest he should be further evaluated for an anxiety disorder include his stomachaches, avoidance of social activities, and frequent feelings of  embarrassment in social situations. The 25-item Parent-Rated Anxiety Scale for ASD (PRAS-ASD) is a reliable and valid scale for measuring anxiety in youth with ASD. Prior to DSM-5, Brandon would have met criteria for Asperger's disorder, which identified a cluster of individuals with core autism features (social deficits and fixated interests) and normal intelligence. Perhaps because he shared autism spectrum symptoms with his own father, however, Brandon was viewed as \"a little odd\" but without problems that merited specific clinical attention. The lack of a diagnosis contributed to Brandon's having become the defenseless target of malicious bullying, a not uncommon finding in people with ASD. Brandon has experienced passive suicidal thoughts. Individuals with ASD are at elevated risk for suicidal thoughts and completed suicide, and it will be important for Brandon to periodically receive careful safety assessments in the future. Without appropriate interventions for both his core ASD symptoms and his stuttering, Brandon is at serious risk for ongoing psychological trauma and academic derailment. Brandon's ongoing passion for a single subject (in his case, trucks, cars, and trains) is typical for children with ASD. Brandon is sensitive to the fact that his peers no longer share his passion (if they ever did), so he hides his interest. Similarly, he wants to skip swim practice because of his earlier outburst at school. In both cases, his embarrassment is painful, but there are positives as well: Brandon is aware that his behaviors are unusual, and he wants to have friends; his insight and desire to socialize are positive prognostic factors and suggest that appropriate treatment interventions may be beneficial.",

         "Stewart Adelson, M.D. Rosemary Tannock, Ph.D. Carlos was a 19-year-old Hispanic college student in his freshman year at a public university in a large city. He was referred by his guidance counselor to the hospital's outpatient psychiatric clinic for help with academic difficulties. Since starting college 6 months earlier, he had done poorly on tests and been unable to manage his study schedule. His worries that he was going to flunk out of college were leading to anxiety, insomnia, poor concentration, and a general sense of hopelessness. After a particularly tough week, he told his family that he thought he should quit. His mother accompanied him to the clinic that had previously helped both Carlos and his younger brother. The mother specifically wondered whether Carlos's \"ADHD\" might be causing his problems, or whether he had outgrown it.  Carlos had been seen at the same clinic when he was age 9, at which time he had been diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), predominantly  combined type. Notes from that clinical evaluation indicated that Carlos had been in trouble at school for not following instructions, not completing homework, getting out of his seat, losing things, not waiting his turn, and not listening. He had trouble concentrating except in regard to video games, which he \"could play for hours.\" Carlos had apparently been slow to talk, but his birth and developmental histories were otherwise normal. He repeated first grade because of behavioral immaturity and difficulty learning to read. The ease with which Carlos learned English, his second language, was not noted. His family had emigrated to the United States from the Dominican Republic when he was 5 years old. The family was Catholic and attended church every Sunday. Both of his parents worked in maintenance and housekeeping at a local municipal hospital.  During the evaluation when Carlos was age 9, a psychoeducational assessment by a clinical psychologist confirmed reading problems (particularly problems in reading fluency and comprehension). Carlos did not, however, meet the school board criteria for a learning disability, which required evidence of a 20-point discrepancy between IQ and achievement scores. Thus, he was not eligible for special education services. The evaluator had noted Carlos to be eager to do well and anxious about underperforming. His anxiety was thought to be a reaction to his school difficulties and his challenges in meeting the academic expectations of his family. Carlos's pediatrician had recommended pharmacotherapy, but his parents did not want to pursue medication. They cited negative experiences with local youth who used diverted controlled substances and hung out \"on the street.\" Instead, his mother reported taking on an extra job to pay for tutors to help her son \"with concentration and reading.\" The eldest of four siblings, Carlos had done well with this intervention and was now the first member of his family to attend college. The psychiatry trainee carefully reviewed Carlos's academic history; his symptoms, including the course and severity of sadness, anxiety, insomnia, and hopelessness; and his social and developmental history. She obtained collateral history from his family and school records. She used the revised DSM-5-TR Core Cultural Formulation Interview for assistance in obtaining a better understanding of Carlos's acculturation experiences, the family's past feelings about the clinic's recommendations, and what treatment interventions would be relevant and acceptable to Carlos and his family.  The psychiatry trainee learned that Carlos had a childhood history of \"nervousness\" identified by a neighborhood curandera (traditional healer) as ataque de nervios. The family had addressed this problem with supportive prayer and a traditional herbal tea. They had apparently not revealed this to the psychiatrist at the time, thinking he would find it irrelevant and not wishing to seem disrespectful of his authority. During these unrevealed episodes of acute anxiety, Carlos would experience trembling and agitation, palpitations, shortness of breath, dread of harm, and fear of separation from caregivers. Workup by the pediatrician had revealed no physiological cause.  Since starting college, Carlos reported that he had frequently been unable to remain focused while reading and listening to lectures. He was easily sidetracked and therefore had difficulty handing in his written assignments on time. He complained of feeling restless, agitated, and worried. He described difficulty falling asleep, poor energy, and an inability to \"have fun\" like his peers. He reported that the depressive symptoms went \"up and down\" over the course of the week and possibly influenced his problems with concentration; it was hard for him to be certain. He denied substance use. Carlos said that he'd had some great teachers in high school who had understood him, helped him get the meaning of what he read, and allowed him to audiotape lectures and use other formats (e.g., videos, wikis, visual presentations) for final assignments. Without this support at college, he said he felt \"lonely, stupid, a failure-unable to cope.\"  Although advised by his high school teacher to do so, Carlos had not registered with the university's student disability services office. He preferred not to be seen as different from his peers and thought he should be able to get through college by himself. Carlos's family history was positive for ADHD in a younger brother. A cousin was reported to have had \"dyslexia\" and had dropped out of a local community college after one semester. His social and developmental history revealed that he had been well liked by his cluster of friends throughout school. His group consisted of boys and girls and tended to consist of kids more interested in school than in sports. Carlos denied ever having dated or been sexually active, and he also denied having any significant interest in pursuing either of these activities. On examination, Carlos was well-groomed, polite, and soft-spoken. He wore clean jeans,  a T-shirt, and a hoodie that he kept pulling down over his face. He sat quietly and hunched over. He sighed a lot and rarely made eye contact with the clinician. He often tapped his fingers and shuffled in his seat but responded appropriately to questions. His command of English appeared strong, but he spoke with a slight Spanish accent. He often mumbled and mispronounced some multisyllabic words (e.g., he said \"literalchure\" instead of \"literature\" and \"intimate\" when he clearly meant \"intimidate\"). He denied any suicidal thoughts. He appeared motivated to do better. On a follow-up interview with the psychiatry trainee, Carlos asked whether the conversations were confidential. When informed that they were, he hesitantly admitted that he felt overwhelmed by new relationships with college peers. He indicated that \"in my neighborhood growing up, everybody was Dominican, but in college, I'm the only Dominican.\" He also quietly said that he thought he might \"like guys rather than girls.\" He revealed two recent episodes of panic \"like when I was a kid\" that had occurred during social situations. He declined to go into further detail.  After these two initial sessions, the psychiatrist suggested extending the evaluation so that they could optimize a treatment strategy. She told Carlos that she wanted to better understand his mood and anxiety symptoms, as well as how he felt about being the first in his family to go to college (i.e., role transitions), and to talk a little more about his concerns about his sexual orientation. She also referred Carlos for updated psychoeducational testing. This psychoeducational reassessment confirmed that Carlos's reading and writing abilities were substantially and quantifiably below those expected for his age. That report also concluded that these learning difficulties were not attributable to intellectual developmental disorder, uncorrected visual or auditory acuity, psychosocial adversity, or lack of proficiency in the language of academic instruction. The report concluded that Carlos had specific difficulties with reading fluency and comprehension as well as spelling and written expression.",
         "Discussion Carlos presents with a history of ADHD that was diagnosed in childhood. He also appears to have anxiety and panic attacks that recurred in college. His earlier anxiety/ panic had not been previously identified by his pediatrician (although it had been diagnosed as ataque de nervios and treated by a traditional healer in their community).  He also appears to have a new-onset major depressive episode, mild severity, in the context of stressors surrounding acculturation, transition to college, and uncertainty about his sexual orientation. When Carlos was first evaluated at age 9, DSM-IV criteria for ADHD required six of the nine symptoms listed in either of the two categories: inattention or hyperactivity- impulsivity (as well as an onset before age 12). He had been diagnosed as having the combined type of ADHD, indicating the specialty clinic had found at least six symptoms in each of these spheres. Carlos now presents at age 19, and the case report indicates that he may have five different inattentive symptoms and two symptoms related to hyperactivity-impulsivity. This seems to indicate a symptomatic improvement. Partial remission of ADHD is common with age, especially in regard to hyperactivity symptoms. Under DSM-IV, Carlos's ADHD would be said to have remitted. DSM-5 has a lower threshold of five symptoms in either category, rather than six, so Carlos would continue to meet the symptomatic criteria for ADHD. Carlos's anxiety and depression might actually be causing his inattention, however, and ADHD should not be diagnosed if an alternative explanation is more likely. Carlos does appear to have had ADHD as a child, but that earlier evaluation did not uncover the symptoms that were identified by a traditional healer as ataque de nervios. In addition to trying to clarify the cause of his inattention (and whether he actually has ADHD), the ongoing assessment might also explore Carlos's perspective on being the first in his family to attend college and on his identity as \"the only Dominican on campus.\" It would also be useful to tactfully explore issues related to sexual orientation. This might include his sexual feelings and fantasies, the triggers for his recent panic attacks, and his (and his family's) views on homosexual behavior. The case report mentions that members of Carlos's family are observant Catholics and that they sought out a traditional healer for Carlos's ataque de nervios. It would be useful to better understand how Carlos and his family merge aspects of their Catholicism and traditional Afro-Caribbean religions; such an understanding might inform Carlos's perspective on all of his concerns, including the anxiety, depression, and his \"liking guys.\"  Carlos may well have mood and anxiety disorders in addition to ADHD. Academic problems are common in ADHD even in the absence of a specific learning disorder (SLD), although SLDs are also commonly comorbid with ADHD. Even before his repeat psychological testing, Carlos appeared to have multiple historical issues that increase the likelihood of an SLD. His speech was delayed in his first language, Spanish; his reading was slow in both Spanish and English; and he received (and thrived with) educational accommodations in high school. All of these suggest an SLD, as does his positive family history for learning disability.  Carlos's previous psychoeducational assessment failed to confirm a learning disorder because he did not meet the required discrepancy between IQ and achievement for diagnosis with an SLD. Based on an additional decade of evidence, DSM-5 eliminated this discrepancy criterion for SLD. This change has made it reasonable to refer older adolescent patients for reevaluation. The repeat psychological testing indicates a moderately severe SLD. Because Carlos's learning difficulties began when he was school age and continue to cause academic impairment, he meets the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for SLD. Documentation of both ADHD and SLD will enable Carlos to access academic accommodations that should allow him to more robustly pursue his college studies.",

         "Arden D. Dingle, M.D.  Daphne, a 13-year-old in the ninth grade, was brought for a psychiatric evaluation because of academic and behavioral struggles. She had particular difficulty starting and completing schoolwork and following instructions, and she had received failing grades in math. When prompted to complete tasks, Daphne became argumentative and irritable. She had become increasingly resistant to attending school, asking to stay home with her mother. These difficulties had been evident since early childhood but had worsened significantly this year. Because Daphne had become increasingly distressed, her parents have been less insistent on making her do any activity that upsets her. Psychological testing indicated that Daphne had above-average intelligence, age- appropriate achievement in all subjects except math, and some difficulties in visuospatial skills. The test results were shared with the school, which offered additional tutoring. Daphne attended only a few sessions, stating that they were not helpful. Her parents talked to the school counselors and Daphne's teachers, asking for more services. They were told repeatedly that Daphne needed to be more assertive and ask for help. Several teachers commented that Daphne should be more motivated and try harder. Several years earlier, her pediatrician had diagnosed ADHD and prescribed a stimulant.  She took the medication for a week, but her parents stopped giving it to her because she seemed agitated. At home, Daphne's parents' close supervision of her homework often led to arguments with crying and screaming. Her behavior and attitude were noticeably better when she was out of school. She had two long-standing friends but had made no new close friends for several years. In groups with other children, she preferred to play with those younger than she. When her friends chose the activity or did not follow her rules, she tended to withdraw. She was generally quiet in groups and in school but more interactive with family members and individuals she knew well. Since early childhood, Daphne has had difficulty falling asleep, requiring a nightlight and parental reassurance. Recognizing that Daphne was easily upset by change, her parents rarely forced her into new activities. She did well during the summer, which she spent with her grandparents. Her parents reported no particular traumas, stressors, or developmental or medical problems. Daphne had started her menses about 2 months prior to the evaluation. Her family history was pertinent for multiple first- and second- degree relatives with mood, anxiety, or learning disorders. At first meeting, Daphne was shy and tense. Her eye contact was poor, and she had difficulty talking about anything other than her plastic horse collection. Within 15 minutes, she became more comfortable, revealing that she disliked school because the work was too hard. She thought that other children did not seem to like her because she was stupid and was not into clothes and dating. Sometimes they made fun of her and would start laughing whenever the teacher called on her. There were several peers who had similar interests in animals and seemed okay. She has been eating lunch with them but found it hard to relax and to believe that they really wanted to be friends. Daphne was always afraid of making mistakes, getting bad grades, and disappointing everyone. Often, she was so preoccupied with what to say or do next that she did not pay attention to her peers or teachers. She frequently was unable to make a decision for fear of not being right. Daphne was unable to identify any personal strengths or any aspect of her life that was going well. She wished she had more friends and that she was smarter. As long as she could remember, she had always felt this way. These difficulties made her sad, but she denied persistent depressive feelings or suicidal thoughts. She appeared  anxious but brightened when discussing her horse figurine collection, her longtime friends, and her family.",
         "Discussion Daphne has symptoms of inattention, anxiety, academic difficulties, limited peer relationships, and poor self-esteem that are causing distress and impaired functioning. Biologically, Daphne is experiencing the hormonal changes of puberty against the backdrop of a family history of mood, anxiety, and learning disorders. Psychologically, Daphne is living with the belief that she is inadequate, probably connected with her ongoing academic and social difficulties. Developmentally, Daphne's emotional and social functioning appears to be somewhat delayed, with younger-than-expected interests and coping strategies. Socially, Daphne has a supportive family environment that has emphasized protecting her, possibly interfering with the acquisition of skills related to independence and autonomy. Meanwhile, the educational system has not provided the necessary support for Daphne to succeed.  Daphne's academic problems can be explained in part by a specific learning disorder in mathematics. She has persistent difficulties with math, supported by testing that showed her performance to be below her intellectual level and chronological age. Her achievement in other academic subjects and her level of adaptive functioning generally appear to be age appropriate, indicating that her global intelligence and adaptive functioning are normal and that she does not have an intellectual developmental disorder. It can be difficult to distinguish between anxiety and mood disorders in children Daphne's age. In this case, an anxiety disorder is more likely because Daphne's symptoms have been chronic and persistent rather than episodic, which depressive symptoms often are. Daphne's sadness is related to her sense of failure and worry about her competence. With the exception of a sleep disturbance, she does not have neurovegetative symptoms. Her difficulty with falling asleep appears anxiety based, as do her social ineptitude, reluctance to comply with school demands, and overreaction when faced with unwelcome tasks. In addition to her anxiety about her capabilities, Daphne appears to have concerns about security, which may explain her tense  appearance. Daphne manages her anxieties by avoiding or controlling activities. Although some of her concerns are consistent with other anxiety disorders, such as social anxiety disorder or separation anxiety disorder, Daphne's worries extend beyond those domains. Given the pervasiveness of her anxiety, the most appropriate diagnosis is generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). GAD is characterized by persistent, excessive anxiety and worry. Symptom criteria include restlessness, poor concentration, irritability, muscle tension, sleep disturbance, and being easily fatigued. Although three of six criteria are required for adults, a GAD diagnosis can be made in children with only one symptom in addition to the excessive anxiety and worry. Social difficulties are common among children and adolescents, particularly those with psychiatric disorders. Daphne's issues are related to her anxiety about being competent and likable. Her academic struggles and anxiety have impeded her development, making her emotionally and socially immature. Her immaturity might suggest an autism spectrum disorder. She does have difficulty initiating social interactions and engaging in reciprocity with peers (with poor eye contact notable on examination), but Daphne does not have the communication difficulties, rigidity, or stereotyped behaviors associated with autism. Her behavior improves with familiarity, and she expresses interest in her peers. Daphne's language, speech, and communication skills seem developmentally appropriate, making disorders in these areas unlikely. Oppositional defiant disorder might also be considered because Daphne is resistant and uncooperative in school and at home when it comes to her academic work. However, this attitude and behavior do not carry over to other situations, and her behaviors do not meet oppositional defiant disorder's requirements for symptom level and frequency. They are better conceptualized as a manifestation of anxiety and an attempt at its management. Inattention is a symptom that occurs in a variety of diagnoses. Individuals with ADHD have problems with attention, impulsivity, and/or hyperactivity that occur in multiple  settings prior to age 12 and cause significant impairment. Although Daphne has several symptoms consistent with inattention, these seem confined to school settings. She also does not appear to have significant problems with behaviors related to impulsivity or activity regulation. ADHD should remain a diagnostic possibility, but other diagnoses better account for Daphne's difficulties. The environmental contributions to Daphne's problems should not be minimized. Her central psychiatric diagnoses-a specific learning disorder in mathematics and GAD-do not appear to have been adequately addressed either at home or at school. With more adequate services, Daphne would likely feel less anxiety and emotional distress and be far more likely to succeed in her course work and to stay on track developmentally. Although the case report indicates that Daphne's diagnosis and treatment were delayed, we do not know much about her demographic background. In general, we know that learning disorders in children often go unidentified, especially for children whose families are poor, members of historically marginalized groups, immigrants, or living in adverse circumstances. Daphne's parents tried to advocate for a more thorough diagnosis (and treatment), with little apparent success. Their efforts to shield Daphne from stress were well meaning but might have prevented her from gaining successful experiences and contributed to her sense of incompetence. It would be useful to better understand Daphne's perspective on her anxiety, her academic performance, and anything else that she finds interesting or problematic. She has experienced negative, critical comments that might have escalated to bullying and harassment. An evaluation that looks specifically for these common experiences is likely not only to find additional problems but also to be felt as empathic by patients who might otherwise quietly hold on to private shames.",

         "Robert Haskell, M.D. John T. Walkup, M.D. Ethan, a 9-year-old boy, was referred to a psychiatric clinic by his teacher, who noticed that his attention was flagging. At that time, Ethan was a fourth grader at a private regular-education school for boys. The teacher told Ethan's parents that although Ethan had been among the best students in his class in the fall, his grades had slipped during the spring semester. He tended to get fidgety and distracted when the academic work became more challenging, and the teacher suggested the parents seek neuropsychiatric testing for him. At home, Ethan's mother explained, he seemed more emotional of late: \"He just looks weepy sometimes, which is unusual for him.\" She denied any difficulties at home, and she described her husband, son, 8-year-old daughter, and herself as a \"happy family.\" She had noticed, however, that Ethan seemed uneasy about being left alone. He had  become \"clingy,\" often following his parents around the house, and he hated being in any room by himself. Ethan had also started climbing into bed with his parents in the middle of the night, something he had never done in the past. Although Ethan had a few good friends in the neighborhood and at school and was glad to have other kids come to his house, he refused to go on sleepovers. Ethan's mother agreed that he appeared more fidgety. She had noticed that he often seemed to be shrugging his shoulders, grimacing, and blinking, which she took to be a sign of anxiety. These movements worsened when he was tired or frustrated, and they diminished in frequency during calm, focused activities such as clarinet practice or homework, especially when she was helping him. His mother also mentioned that Ethan had suddenly become \"superstitious.\" Whenever he stepped through a doorway, he would go back and forth until he touched both doorjambs with his hands simultaneously, twice in rapid succession. She hoped that Ethan's more conspicuous habits would subside by summer, when the family took its annual vacation. She felt that it was the right year for Disneyland, but Ethan's father had suggested taking him on a fishing trip (\"just the boys\") while mother and daughter visited relatives in New York City. Ethan's mother recalled her son as an \"easy child, but sensitive.\" He was the product of a planned, uncomplicated pregnancy and met all his developmental milestones on time. He had no history of medical problems or recent infections, but his mother mentioned that he had begun to make frequent visits to the school nurse's office complaining of stomachaches. On examination, Ethan was a slightly built boy with fair, freckly skin and blond hair. He was somewhat fidgety, tugging at his pants and shifting in his seat. Hearing his mother talk about his new movements seemed to provoke them, and the examiner noted that Ethan also occasionally blinked tightly, rolled his eyes, and made throat-clearing noises. Ethan said that he sometimes worried about \"bad things\" happening to his parents. His concerns were vague, however, and he seemed to fear only that burglars might break into their house.",
         "Discussion  Ethan presents with declining school performance, which his family seems to attribute to a cluster of anxiety symptoms that are of relatively recent onset. He is uneasy with solitude and reluctant to attend sleepovers, has fears that bad things will happen to his parents, and makes frequent trips to the school nurse. He appears to meet criteria for DSM-5 separation anxiety disorder, the symptoms of which need only persist for 1 month in children and adolescents. Ethan's mother also points out that he has become more fidgety. She links his shoulder shrugging, grimacing, and blinking to this recent onset of separation anxiety. Neither the parents nor the teacher appears to recognize these movements as tics, which are nonrhythmic movements of short duration and sudden onset. Ethan appears to have a variety of tics, including those observed by the interviewer: some motor (blinks, shoulder rolls) and some vocal (chirps, grunts, throat clearing, sniffs, clicks). Tics can be simple, meaning that they last only milliseconds, or complex, which are of longer duration or consist of a chain or sequence of movements. Although tics may vary broadly throughout the course of a tic disorder, they tend to recur in a specific repertoire during any given period of the illness.  The specific tic disorder (if any) is determined by the type and duration of movements. In Tourette's disorder, both motor and vocal tics must be present, whereas in persistent (chronic) motor or vocal tic disorder, only motor or vocal tics are present. Ethan has a mixture of tics, but at this point they have been present for only about 6 months-not the minimum of 1 year required for either Tourette's disorder or persistent tic disorder. Therefore, Ethan is diagnosed with provisional tic disorder.  Tics occur in 15%-20% of children, and it appears that 0.6%-1.0% develop Tourette's disorder. On average, tics emerge between ages 4 and 6, reach peak severity by age 10- 12, and generally decline in severity during adolescence. Tics first observed in adulthood were very likely present but unnoticed in childhood. Tics are typically worsened by anxiety, excitement, and exhaustion and abate during calm, focused activity-which is why that fishing trip with dad may be Ethan's best bet for a summer vacation. Anxiety likely explains Ethan's inattention in the classroom. Although attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder, inattentive subtype, cannot be ruled out, it seems more probable  that tics and anxiety have taken Ethan off task, as he has no early history of inattention or hyperactivity. His success in the fall semester all but rules out a learning disorder, so no testing is indicated. (As a rule, testing should always follow the treatment of a confounding problem such as anxiety.) Ethan does manifest rituals in the doorway, which suggests OCD, which is an illness that often co-occurs with both anxiety and tic disorders. Although that possibility might be further explored, a diagnosis of OCD-like that of other psychiatric disorders-requires not only symptoms but also a clinical evaluation that finds the symptoms are distressing or impairing. Without additional information as to whether the rituals have an impact on him, Ethan would not meet criteria for OCD.",

Barnhill, M.D.  Schizophrenia is the prototypical psychotic disorder. Not only is it the most common psychosis, but schizophrenia tends to involve abnormalities in all five of the emphasized symptom domains: hallucinations, delusions, disorganized thinking (speech), grossly disorganized or abnormal motor behavior (including catatonia), and negative symptoms. Like the DSM-5 neurodevelopmental disorders, schizophrenia is viewed as a neuropsychiatric disorder with complex genetics and a clinical course that tends to begin during a predictable stage of development. Whereas the neurodevelopmental disorders tend to begin during childhood, symptoms of schizophrenia tend to develop during late adolescence and early adulthood.  The schizophrenia diagnosis underwent some minor revisions in DSM-5. For example, because of their limited diagnostic stability, low reliability, and poor validity,  schizophrenia subtypes were eliminated. These subtypes had included such categories as disorganized, paranoid, and residual types of schizophrenia. Long associated with schizophrenia, catatonia remains one of the potential diagnostic criteria for most of the psychotic diagnoses, including schizophrenia, but it can also be designated as a specifier for other psychiatric and nonpsychiatric medical conditions, including depressive and bipolar disorders. \"Other specified catatonia\" can also be diagnosed when criteria are either uncertain or incomplete for either the catatonia or the comorbid psychiatric or nonpsychiatric medical condition. The DSM-5 schizophrenia diagnosis continues to require persistence of two of five symptomatic criteria (delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, disorganized behavior or catatonia, and negative symptoms). One pertinent change in DSM-5 was the elimination of a special status for particular types of delusions and hallucinations, any one of which would previously have been adequate to fulfill symptomatic criteria for schizophrenia. A second change was the requirement for one of the two symptomatic criteria to be a positive symptom, such as delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized thinking. On the basis of recent research, DSM-5-TR has expanded its discussion of the impacts of stress and early life experience on the development of schizophrenia. For example, early trauma and neglect appear to be associated with both increased rates and increased severity of schizophrenia. Similarly, asylum seekers may have higher rates, as might members of ethnic minority groups when they live in areas with lower proportions of ethnic groups. Most often implicated in these rates of schizophrenia are various sorts of trauma, including discrimination, stigmatization, and reduced levels of social support. Criteria for schizoaffective disorder were tightened in DSM-5. As was the case in DSM- IV, a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder requires that the patient meet criteria for schizophrenia and have symptoms of either major depressive or bipolar disorder concurrent with having active symptoms of schizophrenia. Also, as was the case previously, there must have been a 2-week period of delusions or hallucinations without prominent mood symptoms. The significant change in DSM-5 was that criteria for a major mood disorder must have been met for the majority of the total duration of the  active and residual phases of the overall illness. Therefore, the schizoaffective diagnosis requires more attention to the longitudinal course than was previously the case. Furthermore, the diagnostic requirement that major mood symptoms be present during most of the course of the psychotic disorder (including both the active and the residual phases) is expected to lead to a significant reduction in the number of people who meet criteria for schizoaffective disorder. Delusional disorder remains focused on the presence of delusions in the absence of other active symptoms of schizophrenia, depressive or bipolar disorders, and pertinent substance use. Bizarre delusions are now included as symptomatic criteria for delusional disorder, whereas delusions that are considered to be part of body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) should not lead to a delusional disorder diagnosis but rather to a primary diagnosis of either BDD or OCD, along with the \"absent insight/delusional beliefs\" specifier. Brief psychotic disorder and schizophreniform disorder remained essentially unchanged in DSM-5. They are distinguished from schizophrenia primarily on the basis of the duration of symptoms, with brief psychotic episode referring to people who have symptoms for less than 1 month, and schizophreniform referring to people who have symptoms lasting 1-6 months. DSM-5-TR does discuss evidence indicating that brief psychotic episode often has a favorable prognosis, despite relapse rates that may be higher than 50%. Similarly, although most people with a provisional schizophreniform diagnosis go on to receive a schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder diagnosis, one- third appear to recover within that 6-month window.  Not specifically discussed in this text are cases that involve atypical or incomplete presentations or situations such as the emergency room setting, where information is often incomplete. Within DSM-5, these diagnostic categories are referred to as \"other specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder,\" \"unspecified catatonia,\" and \"unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder.\" The \"other specified\" and \"unspecified\" categories reflect the reality that humans' thoughts, feelings, and behaviors lie on a continuum, as do their disorders, and are provided as diagnostic options throughout much of DSM-5. These diagnostic gray zones  are especially pertinent in regard to schizophrenia spectrum illness. For many people who end up with a chronic illness such as schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, there exists a period of time in which they begin to show symptoms but are not yet diagnosed. It had been proposed that this issue be addressed in DSM-5 by creating a new diagnosis, attenuated psychosis syndrome. Psychiatrists are not yet able to robustly predict which patients are most likely to go on to develop full-blown psychotic symptoms, but accurate prediction is important enough that the syndrome is mentioned in two places. First, attenuated psychosis syndrome can be used as a specifier within this chapter of DSM-5, where it would be listed as \"other specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder (attenuated psychosis syndrome).\" The condition is also discussed in more detail in the \"Conditions for Further Study\" chapter in DSM-5 Section III.

         "Carol A. Tamminga, M.D.  Felicia Allen was a 32-year-old single woman brought to the emergency room (ER) by police after she apparently tried to steal a city bus in Chicago. Because she appeared to  be an \"emotionally disturbed person,\" a psychiatry consultation was requested.  According to the police report, Ms. Allen threatened the driver with a knife, took control of the almost empty city bus, and crashed it. A more complete story was elicited from a friend of Ms. Allen's who had been on the bus but who had not been arrested. According to her, they had boarded the bus on their way to a nearby shopping mall. Ms. Allen became frustrated when the driver refused her dollar bills, instead demanding exact change. She looked in her purse, but instead of finding exact change, she pulled out a kitchen knife that she carried for protection. The driver fled, so she got into the empty seat and drove the bus across the street into a nearby parked car. On examination, Ms. Allen was a handcuffed, heavyset young woman with a bandage on her forehead. She fidgeted and rocked back and forth in her chair. She appeared to be mumbling to herself. When asked what she was saying, the patient made momentary eye contact and just repeated, \"Sorry, sorry.\" She did not respond to other questions. More information was elicited from a psychiatrist who had come to the ER soon after the accident. He said that Ms. Allen and her friend were longtime residents at the state psychiatric hospital where he worked. They had just begun to take passes every week as part of an effort toward social remediation; it had been Ms. Allen's first bus ride without a staff member. According to the psychiatrist, Ms. Allen had received a diagnosis of \"childhood-onset, treatment-resistant paranoid schizophrenia.\" She had started hearing voices by age 5 years. Big, strong, intrusive, and psychotic, she had been hospitalized almost constantly since age 11. Her auditory hallucinations generally consisted of a critical voice commenting on her behavior. Her thinking was concrete, but when relaxed she could be self-reflective. She was motivated to please and recurrently said her biggest goal was to \"have my own room in my own house with my own friends.\" The psychiatrist said that he was not sure what had caused her to pull out the knife. She had not been hallucinating lately and had been feeling less paranoid, but he wondered if she had been more psychotic than she had let on. It was possible that she was just impatient and irritated. The psychiatrist also believed that she had spent almost no period of life developing normally and so had very little experience with the real world.  Ms. Allen had been taking clozapine for 1 year, with good resolution of her auditory hallucinations. She had gained 35 pounds on the clozapine, but she had less trouble getting out of bed in the morning and was functioning at a higher level. She was hoping to get a job and live more independently, and the bus trip had been intended as a step in that direction. Because of these improvements and goals, she had insisted on continuing to take the clozapine despite the weight gain.",
         "Discussion Stealing a city bus is not reasonable, and it reflects Ms. Allen's concrete characteristic of thought and her inability to deal effectively with the world. Her cognitive dysfunction causes her to behave bizarrely. She mumbles and talks to herself, suggesting auditory hallucinations. She lives in a state mental hospital, suggesting severe, persistent mental illness. DSM-5 schizophrenia requires at least two of five symptoms: delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, disorganized or abnormal behavior, and negative symptoms. Functioning must be impaired, and continuous signs of the illness must persist for at least 6 months. Even without any more information about Ms. Allen's history, the diagnosis of schizophrenia is clear. Ms. Allen's psychosis began when she was a child. Early-onset symptoms are often unrecognized because children tend to view their psychotic experience as \"normal.\" Identifying the symptom (e.g., hearing voices that are not there) and associating this with a milestone (e.g., going to a certain grade or school) can help the adult patient retrospectively identify symptom onset. Although the symptoms and treatments are similar for both, childhood-onset schizophrenia is often more severe than adult-onset schizophrenia. Early psychotic symptoms are impairing in and of themselves, but they also deprive the young person of the social learning and cognitive development that take place during critical childhood years.  Ms. Allen's behavior on the bus likely reflects not only the psychosis and cognitive dysfunction that are part of schizophrenia but also her diminished experience in real-life social settings. In addition to treating her psychotic symptoms with clozapine, her psychiatric team appears to be trying to remediate her losses by connecting her to a  \"friend\" and organizing the shopping trip. The treatment team is also quite active and involved, as reflected by the psychiatrist's almost immediate presence in the ER after the bus incident. Schizophrenia is a heterogeneous disorder, affecting multiple domains. It is likely that there are multiple schizophrenias, differentiated by as-yet unknown markers. Because of insufficient evidence about validity, DSM-5 did away with categories such as schizophrenia, paranoid type. Instead, DSM-5 outlines several ways in which the diagnosis can be subtyped. One way is by overall activity and chronicity of symptoms (e.g., single vs. multiple episodes; in acute episode, in partial remission, in full remission). Another way to categorize is by assessing the severity of each of the five core schizophrenia symptoms, using a 0-4 scale.  For example, Ms. Allen was able to try to travel with a \"friend,\" and her hospital-based psychiatrist did arrive in the ER very quickly. These might reflect an engaged, active treatment program, but when combined with her apologetic attitude and her stated efforts toward independence, they likely indicate a relative lack of negative symptoms such as anhedonia, reduced social networks, and alogia. Such activity-driven behavior is unusual in patients with schizophrenia and suggests that she is not depressed. It is hard to judge Ms. Allen's cognitive capacity without testing. Her obvious concrete thinking is represented by a failure to understand the process of paying for her bus ride or abstracting behavioral clues. Whether she has the additional characteristics of a schizophrenia-like working memory disorder or attentional dysfunction is hard to tell from this vignette, but she should be tested. Cognitive training and remediation may be specifically helpful, and cognition may be tested repeatedly using a scale such as the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia.  In addition to assessing the extent of positive symptoms, it is crucial for the field of psychiatry to better understand, categorize, and follow the negative symptoms and cognitive dysfunctions of schizophrenia. Whereas the most effective interventions for schizophrenia have long revolved around the antipsychotic medications that ameliorate positive symptoms, future treatments will likely focus increasingly on the specific behavioral, cognitive, and emotional disturbances that are also an integral part of schizophrenia.",

         "William S. Stone, Ph.D.  Ming T. Tsuang, M.D., Ph.D., D.Sc.  Gregory Baker was a 20-year-old African American man who was brought to the emergency room (ER) by the campus police of the university from which he had been suspended several months earlier. The police had been called by a professor who reported that Mr. Baker had walked into his classroom shouting, \"I am the Joker, and I am looking for Batman.\" When Mr. Baker refused to leave the class, the professor contacted security. Although Mr. Baker had much academic success as a teenager, his behavior had become increasingly odd during the past year. He quit seeing his friends and spent most of his time lying in bed staring at the ceiling. He lived with several family members but rarely spoke to any of them. He had been suspended from college because of lack of attendance. His sister said that she had recurrently seen him mumbling quietly to himself and noted that he would sometimes, at night, stand on the roof of their home and wave his arms as if he were \"conducting a symphony.\" He denied having any  intention of jumping from the roof or having any thoughts of self-harm, but claimed that he felt liberated and in tune with the music when he was on the roof. Although his father and sister had tried to encourage him to see someone at the university's student health clinic, Mr. Baker had never seen a psychiatrist and had no prior hospitalizations. During the prior several months, Mr. Baker had become increasingly preoccupied with a female friend, Anne, who lived down the street. While he insisted to his family that they were engaged, Anne told Mr. Baker's sister that they had hardly ever spoken and certainly were not dating. Mr. Baker's sister also reported that he had written many letters to Anne but never mailed them; instead, they just accumulated on his desk. His family said that they had never known him to use illicit substances or alcohol, and his toxicology screen was negative. When asked about drug use, Mr. Baker appeared angry and did not answer. On examination in the ER, Mr. Baker was a well-groomed young man who was generally uncooperative. He appeared constricted, guarded, inattentive, and preoccupied. He became enraged when the ER staff brought him dinner. He loudly insisted that all of the hospital's food was poisoned and that he would only drink a specific type of bottled water. He was noted to have paranoid, grandiose, and romantic delusions. He appeared to be internally preoccupied, although he denied hallucinations. Mr. Baker reported feeling \"bad\" but denied depression and did not show disturbances in his sleep or appetite. He was adequately oriented to person and place but less so to time. He spoke articulately but refused formal cognitive testing. His insight and judgment were deemed to be poor.  Mr. Baker's grandmother had died in a state psychiatric hospital, where she had lived for 30 years. Her diagnosis was unknown. Mr. Baker's mother was reportedly \"crazy.\" She had abandoned the family when Mr. Baker was young, and he was raised by his father and paternal grandmother. Ultimately, Mr. Baker agreed to sign himself into the psychiatric unit, stating, \"I don't mind staying here. Anne will probably be there, so I can spend my time with her.\"",
         "Discussion  Mr. Baker's case involves an all-too-familiar scenario in which a high-functioning young man undergoes a significant decline. In addition to having paranoid, grandiose, and romantic delusions, Mr. Baker appears to be responding to internal stimuli (i.e., auditory hallucinations) and demonstrating negative symptoms (lying in bed all day). These symptoms have persisted and intensified over the past year. The history does not indicate medications, substances of abuse, or other medical or psychiatric disorders that could cause these symptoms. Therefore, he meets DSM-5 criteria for schizophrenia. Although a family history of psychiatric illness is not a requisite for the diagnosis, Mr. Baker's mother and grandmother appear to have also experienced major mental disorders. Schizophrenia is, however, a heterogeneous disorder. For example, Mr. Baker's most prominent psychotic symptoms are delusions. Another person with schizophrenia might present most prominently with disorganization of speech and behavior and without any delusions. DSM-5 tries to address this heterogeneity by encouraging a dimensional viewpoint rather than a categorical one. In other words, instead of clarifying whether a patient has \"paranoid\" or \"disorganized\" schizophrenia, DSM-5 encourages assessment of a variety of specifiers. One important specifier, the course specifier, requires a longitudinal assessment to determine whether this is a first episode or one of multiple episodes, and whether it is an acute episode, in partial remission, or in full remission.  DSM-5 encourages specific ratings of symptoms. For example, is the current episode accompanied by catatonia? On a 5-point scale (from 0 to 4), how severe is each of the five cardinal schizophrenia symptoms? DSM-5 also encourages an assessment of cognition, mania, and depression domains. For example, some of Mr. Baker's behaviors (e.g., interrupting a class to proclaim his identity as the Joker) may seem to be symptomatic of mania, but they are unaccompanied by disturbances in sleep, mood, or level of activity. Similarly, Mr. Baker said he felt \"bad\" but not depressed. These clinical observations likely distinguish Mr. Baker from other subcategories of people with schizophrenia. As noted, Mr. Baker refused cognitive assessment. Although it would not have contributed to the formal diagnosis, cognitive deficits, like negative symptoms, contribute strongly to individual differences in schizophrenia and to differences in clinical outcomes and functional capacities.  The schizophrenia diagnosis can be made without assessing these severity specifiers. Nevertheless, the use of dimensional ratings improves the ability to assess Mr. Baker for the presence of core symptoms of schizophrenia in a more individualized manner. The inclusion of dimensions that cut across diagnostic categories will facilitate the development of a differential diagnosis that includes bipolar disorder and schizoaffective disorder. These assessments may clarify Mr. Baker's functional prognosis in major life roles (e.g., living arrangement or occupational status). Finally, repeated dimensional assessments may facilitate a longitudinal understanding of Mr. Baker's symptomatology, development, and likely responses to treatment.",

         "Lianne K. Morris Smith, M.D. Dolores Malaspina, M.D., M.P.H. Hakim Coleman was a 25-year-old U.S. Army veteran turned community college student who presented to the emergency room (ER) with his girlfriend and sister. On  examination, he was a tall, slim, and well-groomed young man with glasses. He spoke softly, with an increased latency of speech. His affect was blunted except when he became anxious while discussing his symptoms. Mr. Coleman stated that he had come to the ER at his sister's suggestion. He said he could use a \"general checkup\" because of several days of \"migraines\" and \"hallucinations of a spiritual nature\" that had persisted for 3 months. His headache involved \"sharp, shooting\" sensations in various bilateral locations in his head and a \"ringing\" sensation along the midline of his brain that seemed to worsen when he thought about his vices. Mr. Coleman described his vices as being \"alcohol, cigarettes, disrespecting my parents, girls.\" He denied guilt, anxiety, or preoccupation with any of his military duties during his tour in Iraq, although his sister shared that Hakim's military responsibilities were of a confidential nature. He had joined an evangelical church 4 months earlier in the context of being \"riddled with guilt\" about \"all the things I've done.\" Three months earlier, he began \"hearing voices trying to make me feel guilty\" most days. The last auditory hallucination had been the day before. During these past few months, he became withdrawn and noticed that strangers were commenting on his past sins. Mr. Coleman believed that his migraines and guilt might be due to alcohol withdrawal. He had been drinking three or four cans of beer most days of the week for several years until he \"quit\" 4 months earlier after joining the church. He still drank \"a beer or two\" every other week but felt guilty afterward. He denied alcohol withdrawal symptoms such as tremor and sweats. He had smoked cannabis up to twice monthly for years but completely quit when he joined the church. He denied using other illicit drugs except for one uneventful use of cocaine 3 years earlier. He sometimes would sleep only a few hours and did report some nightmares. Otherwise, Mr. Coleman denied depressive, manic, or psychotic symptoms and violent ideation.  Regarding PTSD, Mr. Coleman's score on the 20-item self-administered PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 was below the cutoff score (between 31 and 33 out of 80) that would indicate probable PTSD in veterans. He denied that his military experience was unusually or especially frightening, horrible, or traumatic. Regarding other stressors, he felt overwhelmed by his current responsibilities, which included attending school and near-  daily church activities. He had been a straight-A student at the start of the school year but was now receiving Bs and Cs. The patient's girlfriend and sister were interviewed separately. They agreed that Mr. Coleman had become socially isolative and quiet, after having previously been fun and outgoing. He had also never been especially religious prior to this episode. His sister believed that Mr. Coleman had been \"brainwashed\" by the church. His girlfriend, however, had attended services with Mr. Coleman. She reported that several members of the congregation had told her they had occasionally talked to new members who felt guilt over their prior behaviors, but none who had ever hallucinated, and they were worried about him. A physical examination of the patient, including a neurological screen, was unremarkable, as were routine laboratory testing, a blood alcohol level, and urine toxicology. A noncontrast head computed tomography (CT) scan was normal.",
         "Discussion The differential diagnosis for a young military veteran with new-onset psychosis and a history of substance use disorder is broad. The primary possibilities include an independent psychotic disorder, PTSD, a mood disorder with psychotic features, a substance-induced psychotic disorder, a psychotic disorder due to another medical condition, and a cultural syndrome. Although his veteran status and some symptoms suggest PTSD, it is important to recognize that schizophrenia and PTSD are highly comorbid, with a number of symptoms occurring in both diagnoses. There can be substantial confusion between independent psychotic disorders and PTSD, with underidentification of psychotic disorders, which can also be precipitated by trauma. PTSD may include flashbacks that have a hallucinatory quality, and hypervigilance may reach paranoid proportions. At the same time, a diagnosis of PTSD requires a traumatic event and a cluster of characteristic symptoms. For Mr. Coleman, however, psychotic symptoms are predominant, and- despite his serving in a military zone-he denies significant traumatic experiences.  Mr. Coleman appears to warrant a diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder, a diagnosis  that differs from schizophrenia in two substantive ways: the total duration of schizophreniform illness-including prodrome, active, and residual phases-is greater than 1 month but less than 6 months. Unlike schizophrenia, there is no criterion that mandates social or occupational impairment. For both schizophreniform disorder and schizophrenia, the patient must meet at least two of five symptomatic criteria. Mr. Coleman describes hallucinations (\"hearing voices trying to make me feel guilty\") and negative symptoms (blunted affect, avolition, social isolation). The case report does not mention delusions or disorganization of either speech or behavior. Not relevant to DSM-5 criteria, but of interest, is that Mr. Coleman reports two Schneiderian symptoms besides auditory hallucinations: ideas of reference and possible cenesthetic hallucinations based on his description of his atypical headaches (\"ringing\" in his brain). Multiple other disorders should be considered before concluding with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder. For example, Mr. Coleman specifically denies prominent depression and mania, both of which can cause psychotic symptoms. A variety of medical conditions can also cause psychosis, but these also seem to not pertain to Mr. Coleman's situation. The patient himself is convinced that his symptoms are due to alcohol. Alcohol can indeed cause psychotic symptoms, whether during acute intoxication, after heavy prolonged use, or during acute withdrawal, but Mr. Coleman's recent drinking appears to have been modest, perhaps \"a beer or two\" every other week. He denies ever having had symptoms of withdrawal or other complications. His hallucinations began months after he cut back on his alcohol use, and the psychotic symptoms persisted for months. Additionally, his laboratory tests, including a hepatic panel and complete blood count, were normal, which would be unusual in patients with the sort of chronic alcohol use that usually accompanies alcohol-induced psychosis or significant withdrawal.  Mr. Coleman's chronic cannabis use could potentially be implicated in the development of psychosis, but his cannabis use has been only sporadic, and he apparently had not used cannabis for several months prior to the onset of hallucinations. His history is confirmed by a negative toxicology screen, which, in a moderate to heavy user, would likely be positive for 1-4 weeks after cessation.  It would appear that Mr. Coleman's concerns about alcohol and cannabis are linked to hyper-religious guilt rather than an actual substance use disorder. The possibility of another medical condition was considered, but his normal laboratory testing and physical examination results provided no such evidence. Schizophreniform disorders last at least 1 month but less than 6 months. In regard to Mr. Coleman, his initial 1-2 months of religious preoccupation and guilty ruminations would be considered a prodromal phase. The 3 months preceding presentation to the ER would represent the active phase of psychosis. Because Mr. Coleman's psychotic symptoms have lasted 4-5 months but are ongoing, he would be said to have provisional schizophreniform disorder. Obviously, everyone who goes on to develop schizophrenia has a 6-month period in which they could be said to have schizophreniform disorder, but about one-third of people with schizophreniform disorder do not go on to develop schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.  Three other diagnostic possibilities that deserve mention are PTSD, a dissociative disorder, and a shared cultural syndrome. The case does not go into depth about Mr. Coleman's military experience, but even if he denies experiencing trauma, the experience of being in an active war zone can be a traumatic exposure in itself. He did not report symptomatic features of PTSD, but it is not clear whether the evaluation systematically searched for such symptoms. Given that avoidance is a cardinal feature of PTSD- making it less likely that he would spontaneously report the symptoms without being prompted-it would be useful to tactfully explore the possibility of PTSD in all people at elevated risk.  Mr. Coleman's family members indicate that his symptoms began around the time of his initiation into an evangelical church and worry that he has been \"brainwashed.\" DSM-5 includes a possibly pertinent category, listed under \"other specified dissociative disorders,\" within the chapter on dissociative disorders. This disorder is reserved for individuals who experience an identity disturbance due to prolonged and coercive persuasion in the context of such experiences as long-term political imprisonment or recruitment by cults. It is also possible that Mr. Coleman's unusual beliefs are a nonpathological  manifestation of religious beliefs that he shares with other members of his church.  It appears that his psychotic symptoms began prior to his entry into the church and may have motivated him to join a church that had previously not been of interest to him. In addition, although he attended church frequently, there is no evidence that he joined a cult or particularly manipulative religious sect. Furthermore, other congregants viewed his hallucinations as aberrant, implying that his views are not part of a shared cultural or religious mindset. The initial diagnosis of provisional schizophreniform disorder is temporary. Longitudinal follow-up will clarify whether Mr. Coleman's symptoms attenuate or progress to a chronic psychotic illness.",

         "Rajiv Tandon, M.D.  Itsuki Daishi was a 23-year-old engineering student from Japan who was referred to his university student mental health clinic by a professor who had become concerned about his irregular class attendance. When they had met to discuss his declining performance, Mr. Daishi had volunteered to the professor that he was distracted by the \"listening devices\" and \"thought control machines\" that had been placed in his apartment. While initially wary of talking to the psychiatrist, Mr. Daishi indicated that he was relieved to finally get a chance to talk in a room that had not yet been bugged. He said that his problems began 3 months earlier, after he returned from a visit to Japan. He said his first indication of trouble was when a classmate sneezed and grinned at him in an odd way. Later that same week, he noticed two strangers lurking suspiciously outside his apartment. Mr. Daishi decided that those lurking strangers had installed tiny mind-control devices throughout his apartment, devices that were intended to weaken his resolve and prepare him for an onslaught of misinformation from Fox News reporters who intended to convert him into being a follower of Donald Trump. After weakening his resolve, Mr. Daishi found himself only able to watch Fox News, and he then found that those television reporters began to relentlessly comment indirectly and critically about him. He soon came to the conclusion that they had targeted him because of his \"superior intelligence\" and because he would soon become the prime minister of Japan. He concluded that the Trump Republicans wanted an ally in Tokyo. Mr. Daishi indicated that he was trying to stay strong, but it was difficult to keep the reporters from putting ideas into his head. Mr. Daishi reported that he became increasingly vigilant, fearing that everyone at school and in his apartment complex was \"in on the plot.\" He slept little, became withdrawn, and stopped attending classes, but he did continue to eat and maintain his personal hygiene. He denied feeling elated or euphoric. He described his level of energy as \"okay\" and his  thinking as clear \"except when they try to put ideas into my head.\" He admitted to feeling extremely fearful for several hours on one occasion during his recent trip to Japan. At that time, he had smoked \"a lot of pot\" and began hearing strange sounds and believing that his friends were laughing at him. He denied any cannabis consumption since his return to the United States and denied ever having experimented with any other substances, saying that he generally would not even drink alcohol. He denied all other history of auditory or visual hallucinations. When Mr. Daishi's uncle, listed as his local guardian, was contacted, he described his nephew as a healthy, intelligent, and somewhat shy boy without any prior history of any major psychiatric illness. He described Mr. Daishi's parents as very loving and supportive, although his father \"might be a little stern.\" There was no family history of any major mental illness. On examination, Mr. Daishi was well groomed and cooperative, with normal psychomotor activity. His speech was coherent and goal directed. He described his mood as \"afraid.\" The range and mobility of his affective expression were normal. He denied any ideas of guilt, suicide, or worthlessness. He was convinced that he was being continuously monitored and that there were \"mind control\" devices in his apartment. He denied hallucinations. His cognitive functions were generally within normal limits. He appeared to have no insight into his beliefs. On investigation, Mr. Daishi's laboratory test results were normal, his head computed tomography scan was unremarkable, and his urine drug screen was negative for any substances of abuse.",
         "Discussion Mr. Daishi meets criteria for delusional disorder, which requires one or more delusions that persist for longer than 1 month but no other psychotic symptoms. Most of Mr. Daishi's delusions are persecutory and related to monitoring devices. He has delusions of reference (a classmate sneezing and grinning at him), persecution (television reporters, mind-control devices), and thought insertion (reporters putting ideas into his head). He warrants the \"mixed type\" specifier because of his grandiosity (his \"superior intelligence\" and plan to become prime minister of Japan) and reduced sleep, but he has no other  symptoms of mania.  Other psychotic disorders should also be considered. The 3-month duration of symptoms is too long for brief psychotic disorder (no longer than 1 month) and too brief for schizophrenia (no briefer than 6 months) but is an appropriate duration for schizophreniform disorder (between 1 and 6 months' duration). Mr. Daishi does not appear, however, to have a second symptom (e.g., hallucinations, negative symptoms, or disorganization) as required for a schizophreniform diagnosis. In DSM-IV, a single bizarre delusion-the delusion of thought insertion-would have been adequate to meet symptomatic criteria for schizophreniform disorder (or schizophrenia), but bizarre delusions no longer receive special treatment among the DSM-5 schizophrenia spectrum disorders.  The absence of manic or major depressive mood symptoms excludes a diagnosis of bipolar disorder (with psychotic features), major depressive disorder (with psychotic features), or schizoaffective disorder. Two environmental factors may also be pertinent to Mr. Daishi's delusions. For one, his long flight from Japan, with associated jet lag and sleep deprivation, may have triggered mania and psychosis. Second, the psychosis appears to have developed around the time that he used cannabis, a drug that can trigger psychotic symptoms when used alone and when adulterated with another substance such as phencyclidine. If evaluated for psychosis immediately after the flight or his use of cannabis, either (or both) might be considered in the diagnosis. Mr. Daishi's symptoms have persisted, however, for more than a month after either of those putative triggers. Jet lag was specifically removed from DSM-5 as a subtype of circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders because its effects tend to be mild and short-lived. In addition, DSM-5 and DSM-5-TR specifically exclude the diagnosis of substance-induced psychotic disorder when symptoms persist for a substantial period of time (e.g., 1 month) following discontinuation of the substance.",

         "Anthony O. Ahmed, Ph.D.  John Evans was a 25-year-old single, unemployed white man who had been seeing a psychiatrist for several years for management of psychosis, depression, anxiety, and abuse of marijuana and alcohol. After an apparently normal childhood, Mr. Evans began to show dysphoric mood, anhedonia, low energy, and social isolation by age 15 years. At about the same time, Mr. Evans began to drink alcohol and smoke marijuana every day. In addition, he developed recurrent panic attacks, marked by a sudden onset of palpitations, diaphoresis, and thoughts that he was going to die. When he was at his most depressed and panicky, he twice received a combination of sertraline 100 mg/day and psychotherapy. In both cases, his most intense depressive symptoms lifted within a few weeks, and he discontinued the sertraline after a few months. Between episodes of severe depression, he was generally seen as sad, irritable, and amotivated. His school performance declined around tenth grade and remained marginal throughout the rest of high school. He did not attend college as his parents had expected him to, but instead lived at home and did odd jobs in the neighborhood.  Around age 20, Mr. Evans developed a psychotic episode in which he had the conviction that he had murdered people when he was 6 years old. Although he could not remember who these people were or the circumstances, he was absolutely convinced that this had happened, something that was confirmed by continuous voices accusing him of being a murderer. He also became convinced that other people would punish him for what had happened, and thus he feared for his life. Over the ensuing few weeks, he became guilt- ridden and preoccupied with the idea that he should kill himself by slashing his wrists, which culminated in his being psychiatrically hospitalized.  Although he was predominantly anxious on admission, Mr. Evans soon became very depressed, with prominent anhedonia, poor sleep, and decreased appetite and concentration. With the combined use of antipsychotic and antidepressant medications, both the depression and the psychotic symptoms remitted after 4 weeks. Therefore, the total duration of the psychotic episode was approximately 7 weeks, 4 of which were also characterized by major depressive disorder. Mr. Evans had been hospitalized with the same pattern of symptoms two additional times before age 22, and each of these episodes started with several weeks of delusions and hallucinations related to his conviction that he had murdered someone when he was a child, followed by severe depression lasting an additional month. Both relapses occurred while he was apparently adherent to reasonable dosages of antipsychotic and antidepressant medications. During the 3 years prior to this evaluation, Mr. Evans had been adherent to clozapine and had been without hallucinations and delusions. He had also been adherent to his antidepressant medication and supportive psychotherapy, although his dysphoria, irritability, and amotivation never completely resolved.  Mr. Evans's history was significant for marijuana and alcohol misuse that began at age 15. Before the onset of psychosis at age 20, he smoked several joints of marijuana almost daily and binge-drank on weekends, with occasional blackouts. After the onset of the psychosis, he decreased his marijuana and alcohol use significantly, with two several- month-long periods of abstinence, yet he continued to have psychotic episodes up through age 22. He started attending Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous groups, achieved sobriety from marijuana and alcohol at age 23, and had remained sober for the 2 years prior to this evaluation.",
         "Discussion\t Mr. Evans has struggled with depression and anxiety since adolescence, worsened by frequent use of marijuana and alcohol. At first, his treaters diagnosed him with depression and panic disorder and treated him accordingly. He did not enter college, as his family had expected, and he has not been employed since graduation from high school. At age 20, psychosis emerged and he required psychiatric hospitalization. His major psychotic symptom is paranoia, with persecutory delusions and paramnesias of homicide. The delusions are worsened by auditory hallucinations, which he experiences as confirmation of his delusions. The delusions and hallucinations occurred almost daily between ages 20 and 22, until they resolved with clozapine treatment. Although he reports difficulties with memory, he has not displayed marked cognitive impairment or disorganization of thought. He is socially isolated and minimally able to interact with others. The extent, severity, and duration of his psychotic symptoms are consistent with the diagnosis of a schizophrenia spectrum disorder. Mr. Evans's psychosis emerged after several years of depression, anxiety, and panic attacks. Since the onset of his psychotic illness, he has experienced multiple episodes of depression, which emerge after periods of delusion and hallucinations and feature overwhelming guilt, prominent anhedonia, poor sleep, and occasional bursts of irritability. He tends to become suicidal when psychosis and depression intensify. Mr. Evans meets criteria for DSM-5 schizoaffective disorder. He has had an uninterrupted period in which his major depressive symptoms were concurrent with his schizophrenia symptoms. He has had several-week periods of hallucinations and delusions without prominent mood symptoms. Since the onset of the active and residual portions of his schizophrenia, the major depressive symptoms have been present most of the time. Mr. Evans also used marijuana and alcohol for 8 years. Although these might have contributed to the emergence of his mood and psychotic symptoms, he continued to experience significant delusions, hallucinations, and depression between ages 20 and 22, when he stopped using marijuana and alcohol for several months. An alcohol- or marijuana-induced depressive, anxiety, or psychotic disorder might have been  considered at various times in Mr. Evans's life, but the persistence of his mood and psychotic symptoms for months after the discontinuation of marijuana and alcohol indicates that he does not have a substance-induced psychiatric disorder. His response to treatment with antipsychotic, antidepressant, and mood-stabilizing medication is typical: several unsuccessful treatments with antipsychotic drugs, the need for combined treatment during periods of exacerbations, and unsuccessful attempts to taper either the antidepressant or the antipsychotic medication. One complicating factor in regard to diagnosing schizoaffective disorder is the reality that although DSM-5 requires that the mood disorder be present for the majority of the active and residual phases of the schizophrenia, mood and psychotic disorders tend to vary significantly in regard to treatment response and clinical course. For example, whereas depressive and bipolar disorders tend to run in cycles, schizophrenia-once it unfolds-tends to persist. Furthermore, depressive and bipolar disorders tend to be more amenable to treatment than schizophrenia, especially because the diagnostic time frame for the latter includes the residual phase of schizophrenia, which can be largely resistant to psychiatric interventions. It remains to be seen how this tightening of the criteria for schizoaffective disorder will affect the identification and treatment of this cluster of patients.",

         "Melissa Nau, M.D. Heather Warm, M.D. Kevin Foster, a 32-year-old married white man with a history of bipolar disorder, was brought to the emergency room (ER) by police after his wife called 911 to report that he was threatening to jump out of their hotel window. At the time of the episode, Mr. Foster and his wife were on vacation, celebrating their fifth anniversary. To commemorate the event, they decided to get tattoos. Afterward, they went to a nearby park, where Mr. Foster bought and smoked a marijuana cigarette. During the ensuing hour, Mr. Foster began to believe that the symbols in his tattoo had mysterious meaning and power. He became convinced that the tattoo artist was conspiring with others against him and that his wife was cheating on him. After returning to the hotel, the patient searched his wife's phone for evidence of her infidelity and threatened to jump out the window. The patient's wife, an ER physician, successfully convinced the patient to go to sleep, thinking that the episode would resolve.  The following day, the patient remained paranoid and delusional. He again threatened to jump out the window, and indicated that he would have no choice but to kill his wife the next time she slept. She called 911, and her husband was brought to the ER of a large nearby hospital. Later that day, he was admitted to an acute inpatient psychiatric unit with a diagnosis of unspecified psychotic disorder. Mr. Foster had smoked cannabis sporadically from age 18 but began to smoke daily 5 years prior to this admission. In the past year, his cannabis use had steadily increased;  previously he had been smoking once per day, but more recently his use had increased to three times a day, beginning when he awoke. He noted that he has begun to feel \"anxious\" when not under the influence of cannabis and believed his thrice-daily use helped him \"even out.\" The patient and his wife denied that he had ever used other illicit substances, and the patient indicated that he rarely drank alcohol. Until 1 year earlier, he had never seen a psychiatrist or been viewed by his friends and family as having significant psychiatric issues. In the past year, however, Mr. Foster had been hospitalized four times for psychiatric problems. He had been hospitalized twice with classic manic symptoms and once for a suicidal depression. In addition, 7 months prior to this presentation, the patient had been hospitalized for a 6-week episode of cannabis-induced psychosis, which responded well to risperidone. At that time, his main symptom was paranoia. Two months prior to this admission, he entered a 1-month inpatient substance abuse treatment program for cannabis use disorder. Until the weekend of this admission, he had continued to smoke marijuana but had not used alcohol or any other substances since discharge from the rehabilitation facility. He had also been functioning well while taking lithium monotherapy for 3 months.  Mr. Foster had been steadily employed as a film editor since graduating from college. His father had a bipolar disorder, and his paternal grandfather committed suicide via gunshot but with an unknown diagnosis. On the second day of hospitalization, Mr. Foster began to realize that his wife was not cheating on him and that the symbols in his tattoo were not meaningful. By the third day, he spontaneously said the paranoia was the result of cannabis intoxication. He declined further risperidone but continued lithium monotherapy. He was discharged with an appointment to follow up with his outpatient psychiatrist.",
         "Discussion Soon after smoking a marijuana cigarette, Mr. Foster began to believe that the symbols of his new tattoo had mysterious meaning and power. Within hours, he became paranoid about the tattoo artist and delusionally jealous. He threatened to kill himself and his wife. He was admitted to a psychiatric unit. The psychotic symptoms cleared within a  few days, and the patient regained appropriate insight. This symptom trajectory fits DSM-5 substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder, which requires delusions or hallucinations that develop during, or soon after, substance intoxication or withdrawal (or after exposure to or withdrawal from a medication). An additional DSM-5 diagnostic criterion for cannabis-induced psychotic disorder revolves around whether Mr. Foster's delusions might not be better explained by an independent psychotic disorder such as schizophrenia or psychotic symptoms within depression or mania. His symptoms resolved within 3 days, which is typical for a cannabis-induced psychosis but not for an independent psychotic disorder. The rapid resolution of symptoms would support the likelihood that the cannabis caused his symptoms. Mr. Foster's psychiatric history complicates the diagnosis in two different ways. First, of the four psychiatric hospitalizations Mr. Foster has had in the past year, one was for paranoid delusions in the context of cannabis use, leading to a 6-week hospitalization. The duration of the actual paranoid delusions is not entirely clear, but they appear to have lasted far longer than would be typical for a cannabis-induced psychosis. DSM-5 specifically cautions that persistence of a psychosis beyond 1 month after the exposure implies that the psychosis may be independent rather than substance induced. Second, of Mr. Foster's three other psychiatric hospitalizations, two were for \"classic\" mania and one was for \"suicidal depression.\" It is not clear whether paranoia or psychosis was part of these episodes. DSM-5 points out that a history of recurrent non- substance-related psychotic episodes would make a substance-induced psychosis less likely. It is not clear whether these psychiatric episodes can be brought together under a single diagnostic umbrella. For example, Mr. Foster could have bipolar disorder with recurrent episodes of depression and mania. The cannabis might help him sleep-which might reduce the mania-but could possibly trigger episodes. If manic and depressive episodes (with or without psychosis) are triggered by a substance but symptoms persist for an extended period of time, then the most accurate diagnosis would be the bipolar disorder. This would be especially true if similar symptoms develop in the absence of substance  use. Mr. Foster has a family history significant for bipolar disorder, which could further support such a diagnosis. On the other hand, Mr. Foster did not endorse any mood symptoms during this most recent psychotic episode, and psychotic symptoms resolved within 2-3 days. This history would seem to indicate that although Mr. Foster has historically met criteria for bipolar disorder, it seems to be currently in remission. Additionally, his recurrent and increasing cannabis use despite adverse consequences (e.g., psychotic episodes requiring hospitalization) suggests a diagnosis of cannabis use disorder, moderate. We can presume that during his hospitalizations he was counseled on the need to cut back his use; however, we see no evidence of this. Furthermore, his use has increased over the past year, with feelings of withdrawal when not using. Multiple schizophrenia spectrum disorders might be considered. Given a 3-day duration of symptoms, however, most diagnoses are quickly eliminated as possibilities. In addition, Mr. Foster appears to have only one affected domain (delusions). Delusional disorder involves only delusions, but the minimum duration is 1 month. Brief psychotic disorder also requires only one of the four primary schizophrenia spectrum symptoms (such as delusions), but it does require an evaluation as to whether the precipitant might be a substance or medication. At the moment, then, a cannabis-induced psychotic disorder appears to be the most likely diagnosis for Mr. Foster's particular episode. Clarification might be possible through more thorough investigation of prior medical records, but even more helpful will be ongoing, longitudinal follow-up.",

         "Julie B. Penzner, M.D.  Lara Gonzalez, a 51-year-old divorced freelance journalist, brought herself to the emergency room requesting dermatological evaluation for flea infestation. When no corroborating evidence was found on skin examination and the patient insisted that she was unsafe at home, she was admitted to an inpatient psychiatric service with \"unspecified psychotic disorder.\" Her concerns began around 1 week prior to presentation. To contend with financial stress, she had taken in temporary renters for a spare room in her home and had begun pet sitting for some neighbors. Under these conditions, she perceived tiny insects burrowing into her skin and walls and covering her rugs and mattress. She had spent the 36 hours prior to presentation frantically cleaning her home, fearing that her tenants would not pay if they saw the fleas. She showered repeatedly, using shampoos meant to treat animal infestations, and she consulted three different exterminators, although none  found evidence of fleas. She threw away a bag of clothing, believing she heard fleas \"rustling and scratching inside.\" She bought replacement clothes that she kept in their own trash bag, thereby spending almost all of her savings, which worsened her preexisting financial strain. Aside from her concerns about infestation, Ms. Gonzalez denied symptoms of depression, mania, and suspiciousness. She denied using any drugs or alcohol. No one in her family had a history of psychiatric illness. Ms. Gonzalez had been diagnosed with depression in college and briefly treated with an antidepressant. She had no relevant medical problems. Her worries about infestation began in the setting of her sister's diagnosis with invasive cancer, the onset of her own menopause, financial strain that was likely forcing her to move from the United States back to Argentina (her country of origin), and a recent breakup with her boyfriend. At baseline, she described herself as an obsessive person who had always had \"contamination phobias\" that historically worsened during times of anxiety. On mental status examination, Ms. Gonzalez was calm and easily engaged, with normal relatedness and eye contact. She offered up a small plastic bag containing \"fleas and larvae\" that she had collected in the hospital while awaiting evaluation. Inspection of the bag revealed lint and plaster. Her speech had an urgent quality to it, and she described her mood as \"sad right now.\" She was tearful intermittently but otherwise smiling reactively. Her thoughts were overly inclusive and intensely focused on fleas. She expressed belief that each time a hair fell out of her head, it would morph into larvae. When crying, she believed an egg came out of her tear duct. She was not suicidal or homicidal. She expressed an unshakable belief that lint was larvae, and that she was infested. She denied hallucinations. Cognition was intact. Her insight was impaired, but her judgment was deemed reasonably appropriate. Dermatological examination revealed no insects or larvae embedded in Ms. Gonzalez's skin. Results of neurological examination, head computed tomography scan, laboratory tests, and toxicology data were normal. She was discharged from the emergency room on a low-dose antipsychotic medication and seen weekly for supportive psychotherapy. Her  preoccupation improved within days and resolved entirely within 2 weeks. She developed enough insight to refer to her belief that fleas were in her skin as a \"crazy thought.\" She attributed her \"break from reality\" to multiple stressors, and was able to articulate that she relied on her delusion as a way to distract herself from real problems. Her family corroborated her quick return to baseline.",
         "Discussion Ms. Gonzalez's delusions with quick return to full premorbid functioning suggest a diagnosis of brief psychotic disorder with marked stressors. Formerly called \"brief reactive psychosis,\" a brief psychotic disorder (with or without marked stressors) may not be diagnosed until return to baseline has occurred. The differential diagnosis of this condition is important. At the time of presentation, the patient was diagnosed with \"unspecified psychotic disorder,\" a term often used when psychosis is present but information is incomplete. Only after her symptoms rapidly resolved could she be diagnosed with a brief psychotic disorder. Ms. Gonzalez's insight returned quite quickly, and she was able to link her symptoms to antecedent stressors. Although treatment is likely to shorten the duration of an acute psychotic episode, DSM-5 specifically does not factor treatment into the requirement that the episode last less than 1 month. It is worth noting that stressors can be positive (e.g., marriage, new job, new baby) or negative, as in Ms. Gonzalez's case. A favorable prognosis is often associated with a history of good premorbid functioning, significant acute stressors, and a lack of family or personal history of psychiatric illness. Stressors can also be medical; two recent case reports have described brief psychotic disorder associated with COVID-19 and related quarantine. Ms. Gonzalez's sleeplessness, behavioral agitation, and premorbid depressive history might also suggest a bipolar episode, but there are no other symptoms to support this diagnosis. Similarly, her delusional obsession with flea infestation suggests a possible delusional disorder, but Ms. Gonzalez's symptoms resolved far too quickly for this to be likely. If her preoccupation with infestation were to persist for a month, as often happens, she would likely warrant a DSM-5 diagnosis of delusional disorder, somatic  subtype; such a diagnosis might also be referred to as \"delusional parasitosis.\"  Patients with personality disorders can have \"micropsychoses,\" but Ms. Gonzalez does not appear to have a personality disorder or a particular personality vulnerability. Malingering and factitious disorder appear unlikely, as do delirium and other medically mediated illnesses. Brief psychotic episodes have a low prevalence in the population, which could indicate that brief psychoses are unusual. It could also indicate that people with a very short duration of psychotic symptoms may not seek psychiatric help. The brevity and unpredictability of symptoms also makes it difficult to do research and for any particular clinician or institution to develop an expertise. Brief psychotic episodes are also noted to have a relatively low stability over time, which makes sense given that-unlike schizophrenia-brief psychotic episodes are, by definition, of short duration and cannot even be diagnosed without both remission of symptoms and careful follow-up.",

Barnhill, M.D.  Bipolar disorders feature a distinct period of mania or hypomania. For example, a patient might develop a relatively acute onset of euphoria, diminished need for sleep, grandiosity, pressured speech, racing thoughts, and a variety of behavioral indiscretions. Absent complicating factors, such a patient would likely be readily identified as having a manic episode as part of bipolar I disorder. Complicating factors abound in diagnosing bipolar and related disorders, however, which is one reason that this chapter features an abundance of cases. Most of the complications relate to symptom evaluation. DSM-5 identified seven symptoms that tend to cluster in bipolar I disorder, and the diagnosis of mania requires three of these symptoms. Each of the symptoms requires clinical judgment in regard to both duration and intensity, and certain problems, such as \"distractibility\" and \"reduced need for sleep,\" are not always obvious during a clinical evaluation. A diagnosis of mania requires  that symptoms from this cluster persist for most of the day, every day, for at least a week. This standard requires an accurate history, which can be difficult to obtain from any patient, but particularly from a patient who may have little insight into the presence of a psychiatric problem (as is often the case for individuals with bipolar disorder). An accurate bipolar history is even more difficult to obtain when the presenting symptom is depression, and manic symptoms might not have been present for many years. Half of patients with bipolar disorder use illicit substances, which can complicate the presentation, diagnosis, and treatment. Depression is so commonly found in bipolar disorder that the disorder was previously called \"manic depression.\" The relationship between the two mood states is not always clear, however, which is one reason that bipolar and related disorders were shifted into a separate chapter in DSM-5. As it turns out, depression can be absent in bipolar disorder, but it can also be the dominant mood state in regard to both frequency and intensity of symptoms. Mood can oscillate between the two poles of depression and mania, or the two can coexist (e.g., a mood episode with mixed features). The relationship between the depressive and manic symptoms is made even more complicated by the reality that patients are more likely to spontaneously complain about dysphoria than about euphoria.  Finally, as is generally the case for disorders throughout DSM-5, a bipolar diagnosis requires impairment. Some of the core symptoms of mania-increased activity, euphoria, and talkativeness-can lead to increased effectiveness and pleasure, at least in the short term, which further complicates the assessment. DSM-5 addressed these uncertainties by describing multiple syndromes within the bipolar spectrum. For example, diagnoses of mania and hypomania both require \"three of seven listed criteria, most of the day, nearly every day.\" However, mania requires at least one episode lasting at least 7 days, whereas hypomania requires only a 4-day duration. Instead of requiring a marked impairment in social or occupational functioning, as specified for mania, hypomania requires an unequivocal change from baseline that is observable by others. These criteria take into consideration the reality that manic and hypomanic patients often lack insight, and the criteria emphasize that hypomania is less severe than mania. Hypomania is a key feature of DSM-5 bipolar II disorder. A second distinguishing feature of bipolar II disorder is the requirement for at least one major depressive episode at a time when hypomanic symptoms are not present.  This requirement is in contrast to bipolar I disorder, which does not require the historical presence of depression. Other patients may have classic manic or hypomanic symptoms but with an apparent physiological precipitant. For example, a patient may have developed manic symptoms immediately after receiving prednisone, a steroid, for a flare-up of systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus). In this case, the clinician might conclude that the patient has bipolar disorder, which would presumably warrant a mood-stabilizing medication. Alternatively, the patient may have had a fairly common reaction to steroids and warrant a diagnosis of medication-induced bipolar disorder (a disorder commonly and inaccurately labeled \"steroid psychosis\"); if so, a likely treatment would be reduction of the steroid medication. The patient's symptoms may, however, be best conceptualized as neuropsychiatric lupus, which in DSM-5 would be called bipolar disorder due to another medical condition. In that case, however, the patient might be best treated by an increase in steroids. One reason that the bipolar diagnosis is so hotly contested is that making the correct diagnosis is vitally important for patient care. The bipolar spectrum also includes clusters of individuals whose mania-related symptoms are significant but who do not meet criteria for bipolar I or II disorder by virtue of the number or duration of symptoms. For example, some patients have a chronic course of alternating hypomanic and subthreshold depressive symptoms. To reach the diagnostic threshold for DSM-5 cyclothymic disorder, these symptoms need to be distressing and persistent (more days than not for at least 2 years-1 year in adolescents-with no more than 2 months without symptoms), and the individual should never have met criteria for a manic episode or a major depressive episode. DSM-5 cyclothymic disorder is quite parallel to DSM-5 persistent depressive disorder in regard to both duration and intensity of symptoms.  Other patients have significant manic symptoms, but an adequate history is not elicited because of the situation (e.g., an emergency room visit); in such cases, the diagnosis would be unspecified bipolar and related disorder. A variety of other patients are diagnosed with other specified bipolar and related disorder. These include people whose manic symptoms either persist for an inadequate duration (e.g., only 2-3 days rather than the required 4 days) or persist for greater than 4 days but do not meet the three of  seven symptomatic criteria for hypomania. Still others meet criteria for hypomania but lack a history of major depressive disorder and therefore do not meet criteria for bipolar II disorder. Others have chronic hypomania and subthreshold depressive symptoms but do not meet the 24-month criterion for cyclothymia. Bipolar spectrum diagnoses have generated significant controversy. One issue relates to duration. It is difficult to make a diagnosis in which the symptoms need be present for only a few days and do not necessarily cause significant distress. Another complication relates to symptom intensity. Distinguishing normal from abnormal is not always easy when the variables include such core human behaviors as talkativeness, risk taking, need for sleep, and self-esteem. To address this controversy, DSM-5 balances two competing interests. The first is to identify robust, discrete symptom clusters that occur within distressed patients. Accurate diagnosis is crucial for a cluster of disorders that cause significant dysfunction and distress and are accompanied by a lifetime risk of suicide that is more than 20 times that in the general population. The second competing interest is to avoid pathologizing normal human experience. Absent reliable tests for \"bipolar disorder,\" the onus is on the clinician to make use of these criteria and to follow available evidence in both the diagnosis and treatment of these challenging patients.

         "Donald M. Hilty, M.D., M.B.A.  An African American man who appeared to be in his 30s was brought to an urban emergency room (ER) by police after neighbors complained that he had been loudly knocking on many doors in the neighborhood. The referral form indicated that the man was \"schizophrenic\" and an \"emotionally disturbed person.\" One of the police officers said that the man offered to pay them for sex while in the back seat of their patrol car. He referred to himself as the \"New Jesus\" and declined to offer another name. He refused to sit and instead ran through the ER. He was put into restraints and received intramuscularly administered lorazepam 2 mg and haloperidol 5 mg. Intravenous diphenhydramine (Benadryl) 50 mg was readied in case of extrapyramidal side effects. The admitting team wrote that he had \"unspecified psychosis\" and transferred him to the psychiatry team that worked in the ER. Despite being restrained, the patient remained giddily agitated, talking about receiving messages from God. When asked when he had last slept, he said he no longer needed sleep, indicating that he had \"been touched by Heaven.\" His speech was rapid, disorganized, and difficult to understand. A complete blood count, blood chemistries, and a toxicology screen were drawn. After an additional 45 minutes of agitation, he received another dose of lorazepam. This calmed him, but he still did not sleep. The restraints were removed. An hour after receiving the initial haloperidol and lorazepam, the patient was interviewed while he sat in a chair in the ER. He was an overweight African American man who was disheveled and malodorous. He did not smell of alcohol. He made poor eye contact, instead looking at nearby people, a ticking clock, the examiner, a nearby nurse- at anything or anyone that moved. His speech was disorganized, rapid, and hard to follow. His leg bounced rapidly up and down, but he did not get out of his chair or threaten the interviewer. He described his mood as \"not bad.\" His affect was labile. He often laughed for no particular reason but would get angrily frustrated when he felt misunderstood. His thought process was disorganized. He had grandiose delusions, and his perceptions were significant for \"God talking to me.\" He denied other hallucinations and denied suicidal and homicidal ideation. When asked the date, he responded with an extended discussion about the underlying meaning of the day's date, which he missed by a single day. He remembered the names of the two police officers who had brought him to the hospital. He refused more cognitive testing. His insight and judgment appeared  poor.  The patient's sister arrived an hour later, after having been called by a neighbor who had seen her brother, Mark Hill, being taken away in a police car. The sister said that her brother had seemed strange a week earlier, uncharacteristically arguing with relatives at a holiday gathering. He had claimed not to need sleep at that time and had been talking about his \"gifts.\" She had tried to contact Mr. Hill since then, but he had not responded to phone, e-mail, or text messages. She said he did not like to talk about his issues, but she had twice seen a bottle of olanzapine in his house. She knew their father had been called \"schizophrenic\" and \"bipolar,\" but she had not seen her father since she was a child. She said that Mr. Hill did not typically use drugs. She also said he was 34 years old and a middle school math teacher who had just finished a semester of teaching.  A review of Mr. Hill's electronic medical record indicated that he had experienced a similar episode 2 years earlier. At that time, a toxicology screen had been negative. He had been hospitalized for 2 weeks on the inpatient psychiatric service and was given a discharge diagnosis of \"schizoaffective disorder\"; he also was prescribed olanzapine and referred to an outpatient clinic for follow-up. The chart had additionally referred to two previous admissions to the county inpatient hospital, but records from that hospital were not available after hours. Over the next 24 hours, Mr. Hill calmed significantly. He continued to believe that he was being misunderstood and that he did not need to be hospitalized. When asked, he agreed that he had a direct connection to God and \"an important role on Earth,\" but he denied having a connection to anyone called the \"New Jesus.\" His speech remained rapid and loud. The interviewer noted that he seemed easier to redirect, though his thoughts continued to jump from idea to idea. He remained tense and jumpy but denied paranoia or fear. Serial physical examinations revealed no abnormalities aside from blisters on his feet. The patient was not tremulous, and his deep tendon reflexes were symmetrical and graded 2 of 4. He showed no neurological asymmetry. His toxicology screen was negative and his blood alcohol level was zero. His initial lab results were pertinent for elevated blood urea nitrogen and a blood sugar level of 210 mg/dL. His mean corpuscular  volume, aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase ratio, and magnesium levels were normal. His BMI was 30.8.",
         "Discussion Safety was the primary initial goal for Mr. Hill. To that end, he was given sedating medications and was, for an hour, placed in restraints. The team's attention quickly turned to diagnosis, and their understanding of the patient evolved over the 24 hours that he was in the ER. Upon admission, the team wrote that he had an \"unspecified psychosis,\" which would be equivalent to DSM-5 \"unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder,\" a diagnosis that is often used in emergency situations when patients present with psychotic symptoms without much collateral information. At that point, the critical diagnostic issue is between the diagnosis that appears most obvious (e.g., a psychosis) and diagnoses that are both common and potentially the most immediately dangerous (e.g., a psychosis or delirium induced by either substance intoxication or withdrawal).  The search in the electronic medical record was important in that it indicated that the patient had presented 2 years earlier with similar symptoms and a negative toxicology screen. Later on the day of the current admission, the evaluating team was further informed by a negative toxicology screen as well as labs suggesting that Mr. Hill was not a chronic, intense user of alcohol; these lab results included a blood alcohol level of zero and normal mean corpuscular volume, aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase ratio, and magnesium levels. His sister's collateral information, in conjunction with Mr. Hill's normal reflexes, lack of tremor, and apparently intact cognition (good memory for the names of the police officers and orientation at least to the date), made alcohol withdrawal highly unlikely.  It was clear that Mr. Hill had some sort of psychosis, but the team did not seem to have developed a clear diagnosis. He had presented to the ER with a classic cluster of symptoms: an expansively irritable mood, grandiosity, a diminished need for sleep, pressured speech, racing thoughts, distractibility, agitation, and sexually inappropriate behavior. Blisters on his feet would be consistent with incessant walking, and elevated blood urea nitrogen and normal creatinine levels would be consistent with dehydration.  In other words, he met every DSM-5 criterion for a manic episode. His psychotic symptoms were loudly impressive, but they would be specifiers for the bipolar illness rather than an indication that the diagnosis belonged within the schizophrenia spectrum. Historical information-much of which became available only toward the end of Mr. Hill's day in the ER-indicated that he was a 34-year-old math teacher who had just finished his teaching semester. People with schizophrenia rarely are able to maintain a highly demanding job like teaching, whereas people with bipolar illness are often quite functional between episodes.  If Mr. Hill's presentation 2 years earlier was indeed similar to his presentation in the current episode, and there was no actual evidence for a history of intermorbid psychotic thinking, it is curious that the earlier team concluded that he had schizoaffective disorder. Cultural issues may have contributed to the earlier diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder. African Americans appear to be diagnosed with schizophrenia much more frequently than non-Latino white individuals, despite not having an elevated actual incidence of the disorder. It is unclear why. It is possible that clinicians from a different cultural subgroup fail to get an adequate history because of some sort of mutual misunderstanding. It is also possible that reduced access to mental health care-perhaps related to economic disparities or lower levels of trust in the medical and/or mental health care system-leads to systematic undertreatment of African Americans. This could lead to more persistent, severe, or bizarre psychotic symptoms, which might then be interpreted, mistakenly, as more likely to be associated with schizophrenia.  Misdiagnosis with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder would have consequences for Mr. Hill. By not having his bipolar disorder properly diagnosed, he would be less likely to receive a mood-stabilizing medication, which could lead to more episodes of both mania and depression. In addition, he might be treated chronically with an antipsychotic medication such as olanzapine, which is well known to cause large weight gains. Mr. Hill is noted to be obese (BMI 30.8) and to have a blood sugar level of 210 mg/dL. His treating team needs to aggressively clarify his diagnosis, both to mitigate the many negative effects of his likely bipolar illness and to avoid iatrogenic medication effects such as weight gain, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome.",

         "Michael Gitlin, M.D.  Nancy Ingram, a 33-year-old stock analyst and married mother of two children, was brought to the emergency room (ER) after 10 days of what her husband described as \"another cycle of depression,\" marked by a hair-trigger temper, tearfulness, and almost no sleep. He noted that these \"dark periods\" had gone on as long as he had known her but that she had experienced at least a half dozen of these episodes in the prior year. He said they typically improved within a few weeks of restarting her fluoxetine. He added that he wondered whether alcohol and clonazepam worsened her symptoms, because she routinely ramped up their use when the dark periods began. Ms. Ingram's husband said he had decided to bring her to the ER after he discovered  that she had recently created a blog entitled Nancy Ingram's Best Stock Picks. Such an activity not only was out of character but also, given her job as a stock analyst for a large investment bank, was strictly against company policy. He said that she had been working on these stock picks around the clock, forgoing her own meals as well as her responsibilities at work and with her children. She countered that she was fine and that her blog would \"make them as rich as Croesus.\" The patient had first been diagnosed with depression in college, after the death of her father from suicide. He had been a wildly erratic, alcohol-abusing businessman whom the patient loved very much. Her paternal grandmother had several \"nervous breakdowns,\" but her diagnosis and treatment history were unknown. Since college, her mood had generally been \"down,\" interspersed with recurrent bouts of worsened dysphoria, insomnia, and uncharacteristically rapid speech and hyperalertness. She had tried psychotherapy sporadically and taken a series of antidepressant medications, but her husband noted that the baseline depression persisted and that the dark periods were increasing in frequency.  Her outpatient psychiatrist noted that Ms. Ingram appeared to have dysthymia (persistent depressive disorder) and recurrent major depressive disorder. He also said that he had never seen her during her periods of edginess and insomnia-she always refused to see him until the \"really down\" periods improved-and that she had refused him access to her husband or to any other source of collateral information. On examination, the patient was pacing angrily in the exam room. She was dressed in jeans and a shirt that was carelessly unbuttoned. Her eyes appeared glazed and unfocused. She responded to the examiner's entrance by sitting down and explaining that this was all a miscommunication, that she was fine and needed to get home immediately to tend to her business. Her speech was rapid, pressured, and very difficult to interrupt. She admitted to not sleeping but denied that it was a problem. She denied hallucinations but admitted, with a smile, to a unique ability to predict the stock market. She refused cognitive testing, saying she would decline the opportunity to be \"a trained seal, a guinea pig, Mr. Ed, and a barking dog, thank you very much, and may I leave now?\" Her insight into her situation appeared poor, and her judgment was deemed to be impaired.",
         "Discussion\t Ms. Ingram presents with tearfulness, irritability, poor sleep, a sad mood, and increasingly unsuccessful treatments for recurrent major depressive disorder. When her symptoms are most intense and disabling, she refuses to see her outpatient psychiatrist. His evaluation has been limited, therefore, and the case report presents symptoms that do not seem to have been incorporated into the diagnostic evaluation. For example, Ms. Ingram presents with speech that is rapid and pressured. Depressed patients with marked anxiety may present with rapid, \"pressured\" speech, but it is more typical to find slow and nonspontaneous speech patterns in depression. She has also created a get-rich- quick investment blog that reflects poor judgment and could get her fired from her job.  These are classic manic symptoms, which should lead to a reformulation of her \"depressive\" symptoms. Diminished sleep is often found in depression but is generally accompanied by daytime fatigue. Ms. Ingram describes a diminished need for sleep without daytime fatigue; this combination is more typical of bipolar mania. Irritability can be part of depression, but it is especially typical of people who have mixed features of both depression and mania. Ms. Ingram's mocking, dismissive attitude during the interview further substantiates this diagnosis, as do her poor insight and judgment. The history indicates at least six of these episodes within the prior year, which meets DSM-5 criteria for the \"with rapid cycling\" specifier for bipolar manic episodes.  Although at least some of her prior \"depressions\" appear to have been marked by pressured irritability, the case report does not indicate whether the prior episodes were accompanied by the level of grandiosity, risk taking, and dysfunction that accompany the current episode. Nevertheless, it appears that Ms. Ingram does have a history of chronic depressive features, possibly persistent depressive disorder, and that these symptoms have been accompanied by hypomanic and, as of this presentation, clearly manic symptoms. This highlights the repeated observation that even though mania/hypomania is the defining feature of bipolar disorder, depression tends to be the dominant pole. On average, patients spend three times as much time depressed as manic/hypomanic. The combination of depressive and manic symptoms indicates that Ms. Ingram's rapid- cycling bipolar disorder qualifies for the \"with mixed features\" specifier.  The differential diagnosis also includes \"mixed depressions,\" which consist of depressive episodes with an admixture of manic/hypomanic symptoms. However, Ms. Ingram manifests more of a full manic/hypomanic picture with some depressive symptoms, rather than a full depressive picture with a few hypomanic features. This suggests that manic episode with mixed features is the more accurate diagnosis and highlights the dimensional and fluid nature of depressive and manic/hypomanic symptoms within mood disorders. Because Ms. Ingram never saw her psychiatrist during her past hypomanic episodes and refused to allow contact between him and others who know her, the psychiatrist was unaware of these hypomanic episodes and was treating her as if she had unipolar depression. This implies that she probably also had true depressive episodes (different from her recurrent mixed hypomanic periods), for which her psychiatrist prescribed fluoxetine. Her past \"response\" to fluoxetine is not easily interpretable given the information presented. Possibilities include the following: that fluoxetine was effective for treating the depression that may have followed the mixed hypomanias (the classic mania- depression-interval sequence in bipolar disorder); that Ms. Ingram was cycling out of her episodes while taking fluoxetine, which had no positive effect; or that the use of the antidepressant, especially without a mood stabilizer, was inducing a more rapid cycling pattern, which would appear as rapid responses to an antidepressant with subsequent rapid relapsing into the next mood state.  Ms. Ingram's family history is consistent with major psychiatric illness, but it is not clear enough to specifically suggest bipolar disorder. A family history of suicide plus alcohol use disorder (in the patient's father) does not help distinguish between unipolar and bipolar depression. The description of Ms. Ingram's father as erratic could reflect the effect of the alcohol use, unrecognized bipolar disorder, or both. Similarly, the description of the patient's paternal grandmother as having had \"nervous breakdowns\" hints at a major psychiatric disorder but is diagnostically nonspecific. The increased use of both clonazepam and alcohol during these manic states is very common. Bipolar disorders are associated with the highest rate of drug or alcohol use  comorbidity among all psychiatric disorders, aside from other substance use disorders. In Ms. Ingram's case, use of clonazepam and alcohol could represent self-medication of her irritable dysphoria or the tendency of manic individuals to push any behavior to excess. Ms. Ingram's family history of alcohol use disorder elevates her risk even further.",

         "Maria A. Oquendo, M.D.  Olivia Jacobs, a 22-year-old graduate student in architecture, was referred for an urgent psychiatric consultation after she told her roommate that she was suicidal. Ms. Jacobs had a history of mood symptoms that had been under good control with lithium and sertraline, but her depressive symptoms had returned soon after she had arrived in a new city for school, 3 months earlier. She had become preoccupied with ways in which she might kill herself without inconveniencing others. Her dominant suicidal thoughts involved shooting herself in the head while leaning out the window, so as not to cause a mess in the dorm. Although she did not have access to a gun, she spent time searching the Web for places where she might purchase one.  Ms. Jacobs's psychiatric history began at age 15, when she began to regularly drink alcohol and smoke marijuana, usually when out at dance clubs with friends. Both of  these substances calmed her, and she denied that either had become problematic. She had used neither alcohol nor marijuana since starting graduate school. Around age 17, she began experiencing brief, intense depressive episodes, marked by tearfulness, feelings of guilt, anhedonia, hopelessness, low energy, and poor concentration. She would sleep more than 12 hours a day and neglect responsibilities at school and home. These depressive episodes would generally shift after a few weeks into periods of increased energy, pressured speech, and unusual creativity. She would stay up most of the night working on projects and building architectural models. These revved-up episodes lasted about 5 days and were punctuated by feelings that her friends had turned against her and that they were not really friends at all. Worried especially about the paranoia, her family had brought her to a psychiatrist, who diagnosed her as having bipolar II disorder and prescribed lithium and sertraline. Although Ms. Jacobs's moods did not completely stabilize on this regimen, she did well enough at a local university to be accepted into a prestigious graduate program far from home. At that point the depression returned, and she became intensely suicidal for the first time.  Upon evaluation, the patient was visibly depressed and tearful, and had psychomotor slowing. She said it was very difficult to get out of bed and she was not attending class most days. She reported hopelessness, poor concentration, and guilt about spending family money for school when she was not able to perform. She stated that she thought about suicide most of the time and that she had found nothing to distract her. She denied recent drinking or smoking marijuana, stating she did not feel like \"partying.\" She acknowledged profound feelings of emptiness and indicated that she had occasionally cut her arms superficially to \"see what it would feel like.\" She stated that she knew that cutting herself in this way would not kill her. She reported depersonalization and occasional panic attacks. She denied having mood instability, derealization, problems with impulsivity, concerns about her identity, and fears of abandonment.",
         "Discussion Ms. Jacobs presents with a current depression marked by depressed mood, anhedonia, sleep problems, anergia, psychomotor retardation, excessive guilt, and recurrent,  persistent thoughts about suicide. These symptoms cause significant distress and impairment and appear to have been present for 3 months, well beyond the 2 weeks required for a DSM-5 diagnosis of major depressive disorder. In addition to the depressive symptoms, she has been treated for bipolar II disorder, which features symptoms of major depressive disorder and hypomania. According to her history, she has had multiple 5-day periods of increased energy, pressured speech, increased creativity and productivity, and diminished need for sleep. These conform to the definition of hypomania. In addition to those symptoms, however, the patient has transiently believed that her friends had turned against her and that they were not really friends at all. If these paranoid symptoms were considered psychotic, then she would warrant a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder. In this case, the paranoia appears closer to being an overvalued idea than a frank delusion, but careful assessment of the patient's ability to reality-test is important.  Ms. Jacobs's illness began when she was in her late teens. The average age at onset of bipolar disorder is about age 25, and symptoms typically start between ages 15 and 30 years. Early age at onset suggests a more severe form of illness, and although Ms. Jacobs has often been very functional, she has already had multiple episodes of both depression and hypomania by age 22. Ms. Jacobs also has a history of alcohol and marijuana use, which she identified as having a \"calming effect.\" The extent of her substance use is not known, but half of those who meet criteria for bipolar disorder also have a comorbid alcohol and/or substance use disorder. Both of these substances can be a problem by themselves, of course, but either one might have also helped trigger some of her initial mood symptoms. She has not, however, used either of them during the 3 months of her most recent depression, and for her mood disorder to be considered \"substance induced,\" her mood symptoms should not persist beyond 1 month after stopping both the alcohol and marijuana. In other words, regardless of the role of substances in initiating symptoms, Ms. Jacobs's bipolar II disorder has taken on a life of its own.  Anxiety disorders are also commonly comorbid with bipolar disorder. Ms. Jacobs described a \"calming effect\" from marijuana and alcohol, which is perhaps an indicator  of unrecognized anxiety. She later experienced episodes of depersonalization and panic attacks, which she found extremely distressing. Pending further information, she may meet criteria for a specific anxiety disorder, but based on available data, she currently meets criteria for an unspecified anxiety disorder. Borderline personality disorder is also frequently comorbid with early-onset bipolar disorder, especially type II. In Ms. Jacobs's case, the presence of depersonalization, feelings of emptiness, substance use, nonsuicidal self-injury, and preoccupation with suicidal thoughts could be considered symptoms of borderline personality disorder. At the same time, however, she denied problems with impulsivity (other than substance misuse), mood instability when not in episode, derealization, concerns about her identity, and fears of abandonment. Although the possibility of a personality disorder cannot be entirely dismissed, Ms. Jacobs does not currently meet criteria for borderline personality disorder. Instead, the overlapping symptoms are likely due to her anxiety and bipolar disorders.  Ms. Jacobs's suicidal ideation is worrisome. Bipolar disorder is associated with the highest suicide rates among all psychiatric conditions, accounting for 25% of all suicides. Roughly one-third of people with bipolar disorder report at least one suicide attempt, 8%-20% of bipolar patients die by suicide, and the lethality of attempts may be even higher in bipolar II than in bipolar I. It is difficult to predict which patients will act on their suicidal thoughts, although associations have been found with early age at onset, first episodes that are depressive, a family history of suicidal acts, and aggressive and impulsive behaviors. Given this patient's diagnosis and suicidal ideation, her current level of suicidal risk appears to be high.",

         "Victoria E. Cosgrove, Ph.D. Trisha Suppes, M.D., Ph.D. Pamela Kershaw was a 43-year-old married librarian who presented to an outpatient mental health clinic with a long history of episodic depressions. Most recently, she described depressed mood during the month since she began a new job. She said she was preoccupied with concerns that her new boss and colleagues thought her work was inadequate and slow and that she was unfriendly. She had no energy and enthusiasm at home, either, and instead of playing with her children or talking to her husband, she tended to watch television for hours, overeat, and sleep excessively. This had led to a 6- pound weight gain in just 3 weeks, which made her feel even worse about herself. She had begun to cry several times a week, which she reported as the sign that she \"knew the depression had returned.\" She had also begun to think often of death, although she had never attempted suicide.  Ms. Kershaw said her memory about her history of depressions was a little fuzzy, so she brought in her husband, who had known her since college. They agreed that she had first become depressed in her teens and that she had experienced at least five discrete periods of depression as an adult. These episodes generally included depressed mood, anergia, amotivation, hypersomnia, hyperphagia, deep feelings of guilt, decreased libido, and mild to moderate suicidal ideation without plan. Her depressions were often punctuated  by periods of \"too much\" energy, irritability, pressured speech, and flight of ideas. These episodes of excess energy could last hours, days, or a couple of weeks. The depressed mood would not lift during these periods, but she would \"at least be able to do a few things.\" When specifically asked, Ms. Kershaw's husband described distinctive times when Ms. Kershaw seemed unusually excited, happy, and self-confident, and like a \"different person.\" She would talk fast, seem energized and optimistic, do the daily chores very efficiently, and start (and often finish) new projects. She would need little sleep and still be enthusiastic the next day. Ms. Kershaw recalled these periods but said they felt \"normal.\" In response to a question about hypersexuality, Ms. Kershaw smiled for the only time during the interview, saying that although her husband seemed to be including her good periods as part of her illness, he had not been complaining when she had her longest such episode (about 6 days) when they first started dating in college. Since then, she reported that these episodes were \"fairly frequent\" and lasted 2 or 3 days.  Because of her periodic low mood and thoughts of death, she had seen various psychiatrists since her mid-teenage years. Psychotherapy tended to work \"okay\" until she had another depressive episode, when she would be unable to attend sessions and would then just quit. Three antidepressant trials of adequate dosage and duration (6 months to 3 years) were each associated with short-term relief of depression, followed by relapse. Both alone and in the presence of her husband, Ms. Kershaw denied any history of alcohol or substance misuse. A maternal aunt and maternal grandfather had been recurrently hospitalized for mania, although Ms. Kershaw was quick to point out that she was \"not at all like them.\" On examination, Ms. Kershaw was a well-groomed, overweight woman who often averted her eyes and tended to speak very softly. No abnormal motor movements were noted, but her movements were constrained, and she did not use hand gestures. Her mood was depressed. Her affect was sad and constricted. Her thought processes were fluid, though possibly slowed. Her thought content was notable for depressive content, including passive suicidal ideation without evidence of paranoia, hallucinations, or delusions. Her insight and judgment were intact.",
         "Discussion\t Ms. Kershaw's recurrent symptoms of depression have caused significant suffering as well as functional impairment. They are also the recurrent impetus for her to seek psychiatric treatment. It is, therefore, tempting to focus only on the depressive symptoms and arrive at a diagnosis of recurrent major depressive disorder. It is generally useful to search broadly for diagnoses, however, and this is especially true in patients whose symptom course or specific symptoms are atypical or whose treatment response has been inadequate. Ms. Kershaw reports an aunt and a grandfather who were hospitalized with episodes of bipolar mania. Although family history is not part of DSM-5 criteria, a strong family history of bipolar disorder should prompt a careful investigation into diagnoses that fall into the bipolar spectrum. When specifically asked, Ms. Kershaw and her husband report that her depressions are often punctuated by episodes of irritability, pressured speech, and flight of ideas. In addition, they describe recurrent, multiday episodes that are not related to depression and in which she is noticeably different from her baseline: she sleeps less, functions more effectively, and seems uncharacteristically happy, excited, pressured, and optimistic. Ms. Kershaw insists that her periods of pressured activity are not like those of her aunt and grandfather, and her symptoms do not, in fact, appear to reach the intensity and duration that are characteristic of bipolar mania. Instead, Ms. Kershaw's energized periods are best described by the term hypomania. Both DSM-5 mania and hypomania require at least three of seven associated symptoms, but there are important differences. One difference is the effect of the symptoms: mania requires significant accompanying distress or dysfunction, whereas hypomania requires only that the symptoms be distinctly noticeable to an observer. The duration requirements are also different. Mania requires a week's persistence of symptoms, whereas hypomania requires 4 days. If an individual meets criteria for mania at any time, bipolar I disorder would be the primary mood-related diagnosis. If the criteria for hypomania have been met at any time without a lifetime history of mania, then diagnosis hinges on whether the individual has a history of major depressive disorder. If so, the individual would warrant a bipolar II disorder diagnosis. This is in contrast to bipolar I  disorder, in which the depression history should be explored but is not integral to the DSM-5 diagnosis. As described in the introduction to this chapter, the so-called bipolar spectrum also includes categories for people who do not quite meet the criteria for number or duration of symptoms or whose symptoms developed in the context of a medical illness or the use of medications or substances of abuse. Because individuals rarely ask psychiatrists to evaluate their \"uncharacteristic energy and enthusiasm,\" the bipolar II diagnosis often hinges on a careful historical review. In Ms. Kershaw's case, she described times of needing less sleep and becoming unusually talkative, pressured, and productive; these would meet the symptomatic criteria for hypomania. Regarding the duration of symptoms, most of Ms. Kershaw's hypomanic episodes last only 2-3 days, which would not meet criteria for bipolar II disorder. She did, however, have one early episode lasting 6 days. Once a hypomanic episode has occurred in a patient with a history of at least one past depressive episode, bipolar II disorder becomes the diagnosis, even if future hypomanic episodes are below the 4-day threshold for a hypomanic episode.  As seen in Ms. Kershaw, hypomanic symptoms often intrude into depression in patients with bipolar II disorder. In other words, hypomania is not always associated with a \"good\" or \"elevated\" mood. It can be useful to ask, for example, about \"energized depression.\" Bipolar II disorder is not simply an attenuated version of bipolar I disorder. Most people with bipolar II disorder have comorbidities that range throughout DSM-5 and include eating disorders, personality disorders, and anxiety disorders. Suicide is an important risk and should be explicitly investigated. Ms. Kershaw's recurrent, debilitating episodes are typical. Furthermore, the diagnosis is often missed. As seen in Ms. Kershaw's situation, the hypomanic periods may not be troublesome and are often a welcome change from the depression. Nevertheless, accurate diagnosis is important for optimizing a treatment that is necessary to mitigate the pain and suffering that often accompany bipolar II disorder.",

         "Robert L. Findling, M.D., M.B.A.  Rachel, a 15-year-old girl, was referred for a psychiatric evaluation because of worsening difficulties at home and at school over the prior year. The mother's chief concern was that \"Rachel's meds aren't working.\" Rachel said she had no particular complaints. In meetings with the patient and her mother, both together and separately, both reported that Rachel's grades had dropped from As and Bs to Cs and Ds, that she had lost many of her long-standing friends, and that conflicts at home had escalated to the point that her mother characterized her as \"nasty and mean.\"  Rachel first saw a psychiatrist at age 7 years when she was evaluated for attention- deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) because of long-standing restlessness, impulsivity, and distractibility. After behavioral interventions were ineffective, the patient began treatment with a methylphenidate-based medication at age 8. Improvement was seen at school, in her social life, and at home. For the ensuing 6 years, Rachel had done well and was \"pretty much like other kids as long as she took her medicine.\" At around age 14, however, Rachel became \"moody.\" Instead of being a \"bubbly teenager,\" she would spend days by herself and hardly speak to anyone. During these periods of persistent sadness, she would sleep more than usual, complain that her friends didn't like her anymore, and not seem interested in anything. At other times, she would be a \"holy terror\" at home, frequently yelling at her sister and parents to the point that everyone was \"walking on eggshells.\" At about that time, Rachel's grades plummeted, and her pediatrician increased the dosage of her ADHD medication. Rachel's family history was pertinent for a father who \"had real problems.\" Although her mother did not know his diagnosis, he had been treated with lithium. The father had left the family before Rachel was born, and the two had never met. In exploring the periods of irritability, dysphoria, and social isolation, the clinician asked whether there had been times in which Rachel was in an especially good mood. The mother recalled multiple periods in which her daughter would be \"giddy\" for a week or two. She would \"laugh at anything\" and would enthusiastically help out with and even initiate household chores. Because these were the \"good phases,\" the mother did not think these episodes were noteworthy. Rachel had no general medical problems. She denied use of alcohol, illicit substances, and medications other than the prescribed ADHD medication. On examination while alone, Rachel was a casually groomed teenager who was coherent and goal directed. She appeared wary and sad, with some affective constriction. She did not like how she had been feeling, saying she felt depressed for a week, then okay, then \"hilarious\" for a few days, then \"murderous,\" like someone was \"churning up my insides.\" She did not know why she felt like that, and she hated not knowing how she  would be feeling the next day. She denied psychotic symptoms, confusion, and suicidal and homicidal thoughts. She was cognitively intact.",
         "Discussion Rachel presents with at least 1 year's history of diminished functioning at school, at home, and with friends. She appears to have several different moods, each of which seems to last at least 1 week. These include being irritable, withdrawn, and giddy, all of which seem to be significantly different from her baseline. The mother thinks these \"might be a stage,\" but the persistence, recurrence, and intensity of these moods have begun to have repercussions in Rachel's life, and so the mother has become concerned. In trying to formulate a diagnosis for Rachel, we notice that much of the case report appears to be filtered through the perspective of the mother. Although helpful, such a story is liable to emphasize behavior, because that is what is most readily observable to parents and teachers. When evaluating adolescents, it is important to explore the teenagers' own perspective on their mood states. Furthermore, it is useful to differentiate between mood swings that are reactive to an external event and mood episodes that tend to be spontaneous and episodic. In Rachel's case, the interview supplied some important information. For example, she clarified that she did not like these mood fluctuations and denied particular precipitants.  A complication of Rachel's history is the presence of relatively nonspecific symptoms. Irritability, dysphoria, and emotional lability are part of multiple psychiatric conditions, particularly during adolescence, when many major psychiatric disorders tend to begin. In addition, it is important to differentiate fluctuations in mood states that are developmentally expected from ones that are not. Nevertheless, from what is known of Rachel's history, a mood disorder is the most likely diagnosis. Rachel's most striking clinical feature is the spontaneous fluctuation between different emotional states. She describes a week or two of hypomania followed by a week or two of sadness followed by a couple of weeks of irritability. These symptoms seem to fit DSM-5 cyclothymic disorder, which requires multiple hypomanic episodes and multiple subsyndromal depressive episodes over a 2-year period (1 year for adolescents like Rachel). To meet the criteria, she should have had symptoms for at least half that time  and should have had no more than a 2-month stretch without symptoms. Furthermore, she should not ever have reached criteria for mania, major depressive disorder, or a schizophrenia spectrum disorder. Although cyclothymic disorder can be seen as a disorder that does not match the intensity of bipolar I disorder, it can cause significant distress and dysfunction and dramatically affect the trajectory of adolescence. Although the potential differential diagnosis for Rachel is broad, several other diagnoses deserve specific mention. Further exploration could lead to a diagnosis of bipolar I or bipolar II disorder. Her father appears to have had a bipolar disorder (he had \"real problems\" and took lithium), and even if Rachel has cyclothymia, she is at risk for developing bipolar I or bipolar II disorder in the future. As more of an alliance is developed with Rachel, it might be possible to more fully evaluate personality issues. For example, cyclothymia is often comorbid with borderline personality disorder. Sleep is not mentioned in the case report, but sleep-wake difficulties can fuel affective instability. Perhaps most likely in a 15-year-old girl is the possibility of substance misuse, because many drugs of abuse can induce mood symptoms via intoxication or withdrawal. Rachel might reveal substance misuse with time, but it might also be useful to get a toxicology screen that can be legitimately framed to Rachel as part of the routine evaluation. Even if the screen is positive only for her ADHD medication, her symptoms should lead to a consideration that she is taking excess amounts on some days and taking none on other days.",

         "Stephen J. Ferrando, M.D.  Sebastian Lopez, a 27-year-old Hispanic freelance editor, was brought to his long-time HIV clinic by his worried partner. As the patient entered the clinic waiting room, he announced, \"God has cured me! I can stop my antivirals!\" While Mr. Lopez fidgeted on a chair, furiously writing on a yellow pad, his partner provided the recent history. He said that the patient had been doing well until approximately 1 month earlier. At that point, he began an unusually intense editing project. After about 10 days of little sleep, \"boundless energy,\" and activity, Mr. Lopez seemed edgy, a little pressured, and \"glassy-eyed.\" That night, the two of them went to a party to celebrate the completion of the work project. Despite several years of Narcotics Anonymous meetings and abstinence from illicit substances, Mr. Lopez took crystal methamphetamine, a stimulant. Acutely anxious and paranoid that they were being followed, Mr. Lopez drank three martinis but still did not sleep that night. Over the ensuing days the patient became less paranoid, but he appeared increasingly distracted and his speech was more pressured.  Mr. Lopez's work project was returned with multiple negative comments and requests for corrections. Instead of focusing on his editing, however, he stayed up late every night, intent on finding a cure for HIV. He made inappropriate, hypersexual advances toward other men at the gym, where he spent much of the day. He lost at least 5 pounds after deciding he should take vitamin supplements instead of food and his antiretroviral medication. He refused to go to the emergency room but finally agreed to come to his  routine AIDS clinic appointment to show his doctors how well he had done despite not having taken his medications in over a month. Mr. Lopez's psychiatric history was without a prior episode of clear-cut mania, but he had been depressed as a teenager during the early phase of his coming-out process. That episode was punctuated by a purposeful overdose and a 2-week psychiatric hospitalization and treatment with antidepressant medication and psychotherapy. Mr. Lopez had discontinued the medication because it made him \"hyper and edgy,\" and he stopped the psychotherapy because \"it was pointless.\" He used methamphetamine frequently for several years, which led to recurrent unprotected intercourse with strangers. Mr. Lopez was diagnosed with HIV at age 22, at which point he went to an outpatient substance use disorder rehabilitation center and discontinued his use of stimulants and alcohol. His lowest CD4 lymphocyte count had been 216 cells/mm3, when he was age 24, at which time his viral load was 1.6 million copies. He had been reportedly adherent to his antiretroviral medications since then. His most recent CD4 count, 6 months prior to this episode, had been 526 cells/mm3. His viral load had been undetectable. He had suffered fatigue but had not had any AIDS-defining illnesses. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain revealed mild cortical atrophy and periventricular white matter disease in excess of what would be expected for his age. The partner was unsure when Mr. Lopez had discontinued his antiretrovirals but thought it might have been months earlier. He also wondered if Mr. Lopez had \"lost a step\" cognitively over the past year.  His family psychiatric history was significant for a maternal aunt who had received lithium and several courses of electroconvulsive therapy, but her diagnosis was unknown. On examination, the patient was a sloppily dressed young man who told a pressured, disjointed story of events over the prior month. He was difficult to direct and was uncharacteristically irritable and devaluing. He was preoccupied with having discovered a cure for HIV through multivitamins and exercise. He denied hallucinations and suicidal and homicidal ideation. He refused cognitive testing, and his insight and  judgment appeared poor.",
         "Discussion Mr. Lopez presents with many classic manic symptoms. He has had a distinct period of elevated, irritable mood with increased energy and goal-directed activity. These symptoms have been present every day, for all or almost all of the day, for several weeks. He demonstrates grandiosity, decreased need for sleep, pressure to keep talking, increased goal-directed activity, and impulsive hypersexuality. These behaviors easily meet the requirement of three of seven symptomatic criteria for a DSM-5 manic episode. The diagnosis of bipolar mania also requires an assessment of etiology, with a particular focus on possible physiological effects of medications or a medical condition. This evaluation is complicated regarding Mr. Lopez. In addition to a classic manic syndrome, Mr. Lopez has a personal history of depression, and during a course of antidepressant medication, he became \"hyper and edgy.\" That response to medication suggests a manic or hypomanic response and an elevated risk for bipolar disorder. In addition, his aunt's use of lithium suggests a family history of bipolar disorder. Absent other comorbidities, this presentation would suggest the diagnosis of bipolar disorder, manic, single episode. However, this case is complicated by two significant comorbidities: the use of crystal methamphetamine and his HIV infection. Amphetamines can induce paranoid psychosis and manic mood symptoms in the setting of both acute and chronic use. In this case, Mr. Lopez's symptoms appear to have begun before he apparently used the stimulant (he was edgy, hyperenergetic, pressured, and glassy-eyed), and they persisted for weeks after his only reported use of the crystal methamphetamine. Stimulant-induced mania typically resolves within days of abstinence, which would better fit Mr. Lopez's acute paranoid reaction to the crystal methamphetamine. In addition, he has a multiple-year history of crystal methamphetamine misuse without reported mania, which might further diminish the likelihood that amphetamine triggered this episode. On the other hand, Mr. Lopez may have been hiding his use of crystal methamphetamine for weeks or months, or he may have used amphetamines to help him complete his recent editing project. Either stimulant would have contributed to sleep deprivation, which is both a precipitant and a  symptom of mania.  HIV infection is also associated with bipolar disorder. Manic symptoms can occur at any stage of infection, but they are most closely associated with relatively late-stage HIV- associated neurocognitive disorder. Symptoms may be identical to a classic mania, but the neurocognitive disorder seems to contribute to unusually prominent irritability and cognitive difficulties. It is difficult to assess a noncompliant patient for cognitive decline, especially when he or she is manic, but Mr. Lopez has been said to have \"lost a step\" over the prior year, is irritable, and has an MRI scan that features the sort of nonspecific findings often found in patients with HIV infection and immune suppression. It appears that Mr. Lopez has been nonadherent to his antiretroviral medication for at least 1 month, possibly longer, and he has not had recent assessment of his T cells or viral load.  Tentatively, then, Mr. Lopez warrants a DSM-5 diagnosis of bipolar and related disorder due to HIV infection, with manic features. A toxicology screen might help clarify whether Mr. Lopez has continued to use amphetamines, whereas a T-cell count and viral load assessment can help determine the degree of immune suppression. After psychiatric stabilization and a resumption of antiretroviral medications, it would be useful to obtain a neuropsychological assessment to clarify the degree of neurocognitive impairment.",

         "Jessica Daniels, M.D.  Taaj Mustafa, a 22-year-old recent college graduate, was brought to the emergency room (ER) by his friends after he appeared bizarrely silent after disappearing for 3 days. Mr. Mustafa's friends reported that he had recently undergone treatment for testicular cancer, but that he had been in a good mood when they had last seen him 4 nights earlier. He had not shown up for a planned get-together the following day and had then not responded to e-mails, texts, or phone calls. They had not known how to contact his parents or relatives and had no other history. In the ER, Mr. Mustafa related to others in an odd manner, standing stiffly and not making eye contact or answering questions. After about 10 minutes, he suddenly grabbed a staff member by the arm. While he seemed to lack a purpose or intent to harm, he refused to let go, and the staff member was unable to extricate herself until a security guard intervened. At that point, he received intramuscular haloperidol and lorazepam. During the ensuing hour, his extremities became rigid, and while lying on a hospital bed, he held his arms above his head, with his elbows bent. He was admitted to the medical service. A head computed tomography (CT) scan, routine laboratory tests, and urine toxicology were noncontributory, except that his creatine phosphokinase (CPK) was elevated, at 906 IU/L. His heart rate was also elevated, at 110 beats per minute. He had no fever, and his blood pressure was within the normal range.  On examination, Mr. Mustafa was found to be a thin young man lying in bed, with his head held awkwardly off the pillow. He was stiffly raising his arms up and down. His hair was falling out in tufts. He stared straight ahead with infrequent blinks, making no eye contact. He was not diaphoretic and did not appear to be in pain. Physical examination revealed an initial resistance against any movement of his arms. When either arm was moved into a position by the examiner, it remained in that position. No myoclonus was evident. Speaking with a long latency and significantly decreased production, he expressed fear that he was dying. As he slowly expressed his anxiety, his body remained  stiff and rigid. He denied auditory or visual hallucinations. He was fully awake and alert and was oriented to time and place but did not participate in other cognitive tests. Mr. Mustafa was clinically unchanged for 3 days while he received intravenous fluids. No psychoactive medication was given. Laboratory tests, an electroencephalogram (EEG), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain were unrevealing, and his CPK trended downward after peaking at 1,100 IU/L. On the fourth hospital day, Mr. Mustafa was given a test dose of intravenous lorazepam 1 mg and then a repeat dose of 1 mg after 5 minutes. He did not become sedated. His mental status did not change, except that his speech was slightly more productive after the second dose. Intravenous lorazepam 1 mg every 4-6 hours was started. After 24 hours, his rigidity had resolved, his speech was fluent and pressured, and he became very active and agitated. He paced the hallways, followed the nurses around, and tried to leave the hospital. He told staff, other patients, and visitors that he was a great artist and that he had cured his cancer. His CPK normalized and tachycardia resolved. He remained afebrile.  Mr. Mustafa's parents arrived from out of town on the sixth hospital day. They reported that his only previous psychiatric history had been a depression that developed when he was diagnosed with testicular cancer 1 year earlier. Mr. Mustafa had been taking sertraline 50 mg/day and was doing well until 10 days prior to admission, when he learned that he had a recurrence of testicular cancer with metastasis to the retroperitoneum. He immediately underwent chemotherapy with cisplatin, etoposide, and dexamethasone. After receiving the chemotherapy, Mr. Mustafa had told his parents over the phone that he felt \"excellent\" but had then not returned their phone calls or e- mails. This was not entirely unusual behavior for their son, who was \"a sketchy correspondent,\" but they had become increasingly worried and finally flew across the country when they had not heard from him in 10 days. The parents also mentioned that the only pertinent family history was a maternal uncle with severe bipolar disorder, which had been treated with electroconvulsive therapy.",
         "Discussion Mr. Mustafa presents with grossly disorganized and abnormal behavior. He manifests a rigid, bizarre posture with waxy flexibility. He lacks appropriate verbal and motor  responses (mutism and stupor), maintains a rigid and fixed posture (catalepsy), and exhibits repetitive or ritualistic movements (stereotypy). Mr. Mustafa's symptoms easily meet the 3 of 12 psychomotor features required for a DSM-5 diagnosis of catatonia. Catatonia has historically been linked to schizophrenia, and one-third of people with schizophrenia have an episode of catatonic symptoms at some point during their lives. It has become clear, however, that most patients with catatonia have a depressive or bipolar disorder. Still other patients have catatonic symptoms as part of a medical disorder (e.g., hepatic encephalitis), a reaction to a medication (e.g., neuroleptic malignant syndrome [NMS]), or a reaction to an illicit substance (e.g., cocaine). The breadth of potential etiologies is an important reason that DSM-5 generally uses the term catatonia as a modifying specifier rather than as the name of a specific type of disorder.  After catatonia is identified and the patient is stabilized, the next clinical focus is diagnosing the underlying cause. This search is urgent, because many of the causes of catatonia are medically dangerous. In addition, catatonia itself can cause severe morbidity and mortality due to dehydration, malnutrition, exhaustion, and profound immobility that can lead to thromboembolism and pressure ulcers. In addition, people with catatonia can hurt themselves or others. Regardless of etiology, catatonia can progress to malignant catatonia, which is marked by fever, autonomic instability, and high fatality rates. Mr. Mustafa's normal neurological and physical examinations, head CT scan, brain MRI scan, and EEG appeared to rule out many of the acute neurological events that can mimic catatonia, such as a stroke (and akinetic mutism), central nervous system malignancy, and locked-in syndrome. Mr. Mustafa remained afebrile, which made it unlikely that his symptoms were caused by infectious encephalitis. A urine drug screen ruled out acute cocaine and phencyclidine intoxication. Other medical causes of catatonia were evaluated and ruled out through noncontributory assessments of thyroid, glucose, HIV, complete blood count, vitamin B12, liver function, lupus antibodies, and a complete metabolic panel. Given his cancer history, a paraneoplastic panel was considered, but he recovered before a lumbar puncture was performed.  NMS is a serious concern. As described in the DSM-5 Section II chapter \"Medication- Induced Movement Disorders and Other Adverse Effects of Medication,\" NMS is a psychiatric emergency characterized by muscle rigidity, fever, autonomic instability, cognitive changes, and an elevated CPK. Mr. Mustafa became \"stiff\" after receiving haloperidol in the ER, was confused, and had an elevated CPK. Mr. Mustafa was never febrile, however, and his vital signs remained stable except for mild tachycardia, which resolved with lorazepam treatment. His elevated CPK likely reflected recent agitation and rigidity and did not reach the greatly elevated range associated with NMS. Whereas NMS is associated with the use of antipsychotic medication, serotonin syndrome is associated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants. Although Mr. Mustafa is taking sertraline and could have taken an overdose, he lacks the typical myoclonus and gastrointestinal symptoms.  With no obvious medical and neurological abnormalities, a psychiatric condition appears the most likely cause of the catatonia. While barely able to speak, Mr. Mustafa did say he was scared and worried that he was dying or dead. Extreme anxiety is the most common affective experience of catatonic patients, to the point that catatonia is sometimes viewed as an extreme \"freeze\" response. This affective experience does not point toward the underlying psychiatric condition, however, and, given the typical patient's inability to communicate, correct diagnosis is often delayed until the catatonia resolves.",
         "Diagnosis and treatment often occur simultaneously with the use of low-dose intravenous lorazepam. Unlike most other patients, people with catatonia often appear more alert and engaged after administration of benzodiazepines. Mr. Mustafa's mutism and stupor seem to have shown subtle improvement immediately but then improved significantly after 24 hours. As his catatonia improved, his underlying mania became more evident. In addition, his parents provided invaluable collateral history that clarified that his manic episode was apparently triggered by a steroid-based chemotherapy regimen.

         "Ian Jones, M.R.C.Psych., Ph.D.  Ursula Norman, a 32-year-old nurse, was brought to an emergency department 6 days after giving birth. Her husband stated that she had been behaving very strangely and that she had become convinced that she had smothered and killed her baby. Her husband reported that after a normal pregnancy and uncomplicated delivery, Ms. Norman had happily gone home with their first child. On the third day after delivery, however, her mood and affect began to shift rapidly between elation and weepiness. She became irritable and anxious. She slept only an hour a night, even when her baby was asleep. Her behavior became increasingly bizarre, with overactivity and agitation. Her speech was rapid and digressive. Although not previously a religious person, she became convinced that God was speaking through her and that she had special powers that could solve the problems of the world. She told her husband that she could identify evil people by looking into their eyes and had begun to worry that she was surrounded by evil people, including her own mother. Most disturbing for her, whenever she was out of sight of her son, she became totally convinced that she had smothered him, and no one could convince her otherwise.  Ms. Norman had a history of three episodes of major depressive disorder in her teens and early 20s. These episodes resolved with psychotherapy and antidepressant medication. She also had a psychiatric admission for mania 3 years prior to the delivery of her child, after a flight from Asia to Europe. Following treatment with antipsychotic medication, she became depressed for several months. Although a diagnosis of bipolar disorder was discussed at this time, she was reluctant to accept this label, attributing the episode to stress and jet lag. She had discontinued the psychiatric medication in anticipation of getting pregnant.  Ms. Norman's own mother had been admitted to a psychiatric hospital shortly after the birth of her first child. This episode was not talked about in the family, and there were few other details. She had no other family history of note. Until just before delivery of her child, Ms. Norman had been a highly functional nurse in a renal unit. Her husband was the head of a sales team, and they lived in comfortable social circumstances. She had no history of illicit drug use and, prior to pregnancy, drank only 2 or 3 units of alcohol a week. On mental status examination, Ms. Norman wandered around the room, seemingly unable to sit for more than a few moments. She was distractible and overtalkative, and demonstrated flight of ideas, flitting from one subject to another. Her mood was labile. At times she appeared happily euphoric. At other times she was tearful, and she could become quickly irritable when she felt she was not being understood. It was clear that she had a number of delusional beliefs but was unwilling to discuss most of them with the examiner. She did insist that she had already killed her own child, which led to several minutes of tears, but she returned to an edgy euphoria within a few minutes. She denied intent to harm herself or anyone else. She appeared inattentive, with poor concentration, but would not participate in formal cognitive testing.  Physical examination and laboratory testing results were all within normal limits.",
         "Discussion Ms. Norman presents with flight of ideas, pressured speech, distractibility, agitation, lability, greatly diminished sleep, uncharacteristic hyperreligiosity, delusions about her  friends and family, and the fixed, false belief that she has already killed her child. She has a history of multiple major depressive episodes and of one psychiatric hospitalization for mania. These qualify her for a DSM-5 diagnosis of bipolar I disorder, severe, with psychotic features. Ms. Norman is also clearly experiencing an episode of what has traditionally been called postpartum psychosis-the abrupt onset of an affective psychosis in the early postpartum period. A number of features of her presentation are characteristic of postpartum psychosis. The onset is typically early in the postpartum period, generally in the first postpartum week. Episodes of postpartum psychosis commonly show a rapid onset and may deteriorate quickly to a florid and severe psychosis. As in Ms. Norman's case, episodes often manifest a \"kaleidoscopic\" presentation, with delusional thoughts, for example, changing frequently rather than becoming fixed and systematized. Because of these characteristics, postpartum psychosis is a true psychiatric emergency and admission is usually required. A comprehensive risk assessment is essential, both for suicidal ideation and for risk of harm to the baby.  Pregnancy leads to a severe postpartum episode in 1 in 1,000 pregnancies, but some women are at considerably higher risk. For example, women with bipolar disorder suffer severe postpartum episodes in approximately 1 in 4 deliveries. In women with a history of postpartum psychosis, the risk in subsequent pregnancies is greater than 1 in 2. Women who are at high risk of a severe postpartum episode should be identified during the antenatal period. With her history of bipolar disorder and a probable family history of postpartum psychosis, Ms. Norman was at very high risk, despite having been well for several years. Given this history, she should have been under close monitoring throughout the pregnancy and postpartum period. After she recovers, it will become important to discuss plans with regard to future pregnancies with both her and her partner. Her case also illustrates that severe postpartum episodes can have a sudden onset in women who have been very well in pregnancy and who have no particular psychosocial predisposing factors.  Ms. Norman had a diagnosis of bipolar disorder prior to this pregnancy. In many cases, however, particularly when postpartum psychosis is the first episode, the diagnosis can  be more uncertain. An early onset of a severe postpartum episode, even in the absence of a prior psychiatric history, should raise suspicion of a bipolar diagnosis. The specific diagnosis of postpartum psychosis is not an option in DSM-5, but as is the case with postpartum depression, the term has remained in common usage by clinicians, women themselves, and user groups (e.g., Action on Postpartum Psychosis: www.app- network.org). Instead, DSM-5 suggests use of a descriptive specifier, \"with peripartum onset.\" There are a number of reasons why flagging the perinatal context of episodes is important. First, the new baby is an important consideration and may affect management decisions (e.g., hospitalization). Second, a severe postpartum episode has important implications for future pregnancies. Third, the close relationship of severe postpartum episodes to bipolar disorder should prompt careful assessments for a history of a bipolar disorder as well as inform future clinical psychiatric treatment.",

         "Holly A. Swartz, M.D.  Victoria Owens, a divorced 58-year-old event planner, scheduled an appointment with a psychiatrist for help with anxiety and depression. Ms. Owens arrived at the appointment well dressed and a little agitated. Speaking at a normal pace, she explained that her depressive symptoms had begun 2 years earlier in the setting of initiating divorce proceedings from her fourth husband. She described poor mood, incapacitating worry about her future, and poor concentration. These symptoms progressed to anhedonia, decreased energy, hypersomnia with interrupted sleep, passive suicidal ideation, and increased appetite with carbohydrate craving. She stopped going to work as an event planner and began spending most of the day in bed.  Ms. Owens initially sought treatment from a homeopath, who prescribed a variety of remedies that were not helpful. She eventually saw her internist, who prescribed alprazolam 0.25 mg three times a day as needed. This medication reduced her worry but had little effect on her mood. Her internist then initiated sertraline 50 mg/day, increasing the dosage (as tolerated) to 200 mg/day. Over the ensuing 2 months, Ms. Owens's sleep improved and she no longer experienced suicidal thoughts. However, she became more anxious, irritable, agitated, and energized and noted that her thoughts moved rapidly. She denied impulsivity and psychotic symptoms. Ms. Owens had a long-standing history of similar depressive episodes. The first such episode occurred during college, lasted for several months, and was untreated. When specifically asked, she described multiple periods in her life when she had moderately elevated mood, rapid thoughts, and increased energy. It seemed that many important life accomplishments occurred during these periods. For instance, as a young, recently divorced unemployed single mother, she agreed to throw a bridal shower for her best friend. She pored over bridal and craft magazines, determined to create a fabulous party on a shoestring budget. She became totally engrossed in the project, seeming to have abundant energy and ideas. The shower was a huge success and launched Ms.  Owens's career as a party planner. She hid her mood swings from her clients and colleagues, leveraging her elevated mood states to project a high-energy \"face,\" but then would retreat and avoid work when her mood became low. She also became more irritable during these high-energy episodes, and she believed that each of her marriages both began and ended because of her tendency to \"get emotional\" when she was in these elevated mood states. Although these periods could last for many weeks, she did not experience changes in sleep, engage in risky behaviors, speak quickly, or become grandiose, and she saw nothing problematic about them.  Ms. Owens also reported that she drank heavily when she was in her 40s but rarely did so now. She denied prior suicide attempts and psychiatric hospitalizations. Her mother had been treated for depression with sertraline, and her brother was treated with lithium for bipolar disorder.",
         "Discussion Ms. Owens has a history of recurrent depressive episodes accompanied by multiple high- energy, high-mood episodes that meet duration criteria (= 4 days) for hypomania but are not characterized by sufficient symptoms to meet full syndromal criteria for a hypomanic episode. She endorsed both elevated mood and energy during these episodes but only two of the seven Criterion B symptoms: racing thoughts and increased goal-directed activity. As is typical for individuals with subthreshold bipolar disorder, Ms. Owens experiences these episodes as ego-syntonic and does not report them spontaneously. Not surprisingly, subthreshold hypomanic episodes are easily missed unless the interviewer carefully probes for them.  Major depressive disorder would also be included in the differential diagnosis. Ms. Owens initially presented to her internist with classic symptoms of depression. Given her prior history of multiple depressive episodes and lack of spontaneous complaints about hypomania, her primary care physician likely assumed that Ms. Owens had major depressive disorder and treated her with an SSRI. The SSRI, however, precipitated a mixed state consisting of an irritable and anxious mood, rapid thoughts, and increased energy. When depressed patients such as Ms. Owens develop mixed, manic, or hypomanic symptoms following exposure to antidepressants, consideration should be  given to a bipolar diagnosis. Ms. Owens's mixed state while taking an SSRI is not sufficient for a diagnosis of bipolar disorder but certainly raises a red flag. Her family history of bipolar disorder (in this case, a brother treated with lithium) further increases the likelihood that she has a form of bipolar disorder. Although the most common mood disorder among first-degree relatives of individuals with bipolar disorder is major depressive disorder, having a relative with bipolar disorder does increase the person's risk of having bipolar disorder as well. Despite features consistent with bipolar disorder, Ms. Owens's clinical picture is complicated. In addition to subthreshold hypomanic symptoms, she also reported a history of unstable relationships, emotional lability, prior substance misuse, and anxiety. Bipolar disorder and personality disorders-especially borderline personality disorder- often co-occur and may be difficult to tease apart because they have clinical features in common. For instance, both bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder are characterized by increased levels of impulsive behavior, affective lability, and irritability. In Ms. Owens's case, lability and irritability appear to be restricted to mood episodes, suggesting that they are secondary to a mood disorder rather than pervasive problems of affect regulation. However, comorbid mood disorder and personality disorder cannot be ruled out.  Up to one-third of patients with bipolar disorder are diagnosed with comorbid anxiety disorders, which are, in turn, associated with worse psychiatric outcomes. Bipolar disorder is often misdiagnosed as an anxiety disorder, perhaps because of the high rates of comorbidity. Similarly, substance use disorders and bipolar disorders often co-occur. Co-occurring anxiety and substance use disorder seem to follow the course of bipolar illness-that is, anxiety disorders tend to associate most with depressive symptoms, and substance use disorders are moderately associated with manic symptoms. Further exploration is needed to determine the presence of comorbidities, and there is a high probability that Ms. Owens suffers from more than one psychiatric disorder.",

Barnhill, M.D.  Depression is one of the most commonly used words in psychiatry, and it is also one of the most ambiguous. As a symptom it can mean sadness, but as a diagnosis it can be applied to people who deny feeling sad. Depressed mood is a common, normal human experience, but it can also reflect a seriously debilitating, distressing, and potentially fatal condition. Depression can present in multiple ways, with many potential comorbidities, precipitants, and reliably associated symptoms. It is important to recognize that depressive symptoms can be found in almost all disorders in DSM-5, and a chief complaint of \"sadness\" is only the beginning of the diagnostic inquiry. It is also useful to recall that essentially all of the major nonmood disorders in DSM-5 increase the likelihood of comorbid major depressive disorder. For example, although bipolar disorder has historically been viewed as \"manic depression,\" and therefore as a subset of depression, it has become increasingly clear that while  bipolar and depressive disorders have similarities, they also have substantive differences in regard to clinical presentation, family history, longitudinal course, and treatment. For these reasons, bipolar disorder was moved into its own chapter in DSM-5. The overlap persists, however, and the depressive and bipolar disorder chapters go into detail in an effort to distinguish the sometimes subtle differences between these diagnoses. Major depressive disorder (MDD) remains the archetypal depressive disorder, and its diagnostic criteria are essentially unchanged in DSM-5. The diagnosis still hinges on the assessment of clinical presentation (presence of five of nine symptoms), history (persistence for longer than 2 weeks), and relevance (significant distress or impairment). To further subdivide this broad category, DSM-5 provides specifiers that distinguish the episode based on severity and recurrence as well as the presence of such factors as melancholia, psychotic features, and catatonia. A particularly useful change from DSM- IV is the delinkage of psychosis and severity, so the clinician can accurately describe people whose depressive symptoms are, say, moderate, but who have an associated psychosis.  The text within DSM-5-TR includes many different assessment tips. For example, many people with depression report insomnia or fatigue rather than depression per se, and a failure to look for depressive symptoms can lead to underdiagnosis. Psychomotor disturbance and guilt (whether delusional or near-delusional) are much less common in MDD than insomnia or fatigue but tend to be markers for greater severity. Culture can affect the diagnosis of depression in multiple ways. Poverty, racism, and marginalization are examples of structural adversities that may contribute to the development of MDD. The prevalence, course, and symptomatology of depression vary among different cultures, but a depressive syndrome has been widely identified across cultures. Although such symptoms are not included in the official criteria, DSM-5-TR suggests being alert to depressive manifestations such as social isolation, anger, tearfulness, and diffuse pain. Somatic complaints are typical presenting complaints of depression in many cultures, and it can be helpful to tactfully explore the meaning of these symptoms as they relate to local social contexts.  Studies consistently indicate that women are significantly more likely than men to  develop MDD. It has been hypothesized that these elevated rates are partly related to women's disproportionate exposure to interpersonal trauma over the life span. In addition, women may be at elevated risk because of their experiences in the reproductive life stages of the perimenstrual, peripartum, and perimenopausal periods. The DSM-5 chapter on depressive disorders also included several changes from DSM-IV that have been the subject of significant scrutiny. The so-called bereavement exclusion has perhaps been the most discussed. It is widely understood that mourning the death of a loved one is a normal human reaction, and DSM-IV clarified that a 2-month period of bereavement was generally necessary before an MDD diagnosis could be made. Evidence indicated, however, that most grieving people do not develop the symptoms of MDD. In other words, MDD that occurs in the context of bereavement is not a \"normal\" reaction. The suffering of MDD tends to include more intense feelings of guilt, worthlessness, and suicidality, for example, and the functional decline is more severe. Furthermore, individuals who develop major depressive symptoms soon after the death of a loved one have elevated rates of depression in their personal and family histories, tend to have a worse prognosis, and tend to respond to antidepressant medications. In other words, individuals who develop all the characteristics of MDD following the death of a loved one are similar to people who develop MDD following any other serious stress and deserve the same level of clinical attention. DSM-5-TR extends this focus on grief by moving prolonged grief disorder from \"Conditions for Further Study\" (where it was called persistent complex bereavement disorder in DSM-5) into the main body of the text, where it is discussed in the chapter on trauma- and stressor-related disorders.  Just as most grief is a normal reaction to loss, temper tantrums are a normal part of childhood. There are, however, children whose low frustration tolerance and behavioral dyscontrol transcend those of normal human experience; their affective dysregulation not only is distressing to their parents, teachers, and classmates, but also is upsetting to the affected children and threatens to derail their normal development. In DSM-5, these children were categorized as having disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD). Controversies about DMDD fall into two camps. In the first, there is concern that the diagnosis might pathologize normal childhood experience. In the second, there is a view that such behavior is more accurately described within the bipolar spectrum of disorders. Evidence indicates, however, that DMDD does describe a cluster of  prepubescent children who are significantly distressed and dysfunctional and who are at risk for a lifetime of difficulty. Furthermore, it appears that DMDD is not simply a childhood form of bipolar disorder. In fact, DMDD is much more likely to convert in adulthood to a depressive or an anxiety disorder than to a bipolar disorder. Another change from DSM-IV was the shift of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) from DSM-IV Appendix B (\"Criteria Sets and Axes Provided for Further Study\") into the main text of DSM-5. Just as DMDD does not refer to average expectable \"temper tantrums,\" PMDD does not describe the transient, mild symptoms that are commonly described as \"premenstrual syndrome.\" Instead, PMDD describes a robust cluster of symptoms that cause persistent, significant debility and distress. Concerns have been raised that these changes could lead to the pathologizing of normal human experience and, secondarily, to the excess use of psychiatric medication. The field of psychiatry should indeed recognize both the limitations of current evidence and the external forces that might try to influence the field for their own reward. At the same time, evidence does indicate that these new diagnoses reflect clusters of people who are suffering and significantly dysfunctional. It is also true that people meeting these criteria are often already seeking psychiatric help, and that the development of rigorous diagnostic criteria allows for replicable research into effective biopsychosocial interventions.

         "William C. Wood, M.D.  Wyatt was a 12-year-old-boy referred by his psychiatrist to an adolescent partial hospitalization program because of repeated conflicts that have frightened both classmates and family members. According to his parents, Wyatt was generally moody and irritable, with frequent episodes of being \"a raging monster.\" It had become almost impossible to set limits. Most recently, Wyatt had smashed a closet door to gain access to a video game that had been withheld to encourage him to do homework. At school, Wyatt was noted to have a hair-trigger temper, and he had recently been suspended for punching another boy in the face after losing a chess match. Wyatt had been an extremely active young boy, running \"all the time.\" He was also a \"sensitive kid\" who constantly worried that things might go wrong. His tolerance for frustration had been less than that of his peers, and his parents quit taking him shopping because he would predictably become distraught whenever they did not buy him whatever toys he wanted. Grade school reports indicated fidgetiness, wandering attention, and impulsivity. When Wyatt was 10 years old, a child psychiatrist diagnosed him as having attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), combined type. Wyatt was referred to a behavioral therapist and started taking methylphenidate, which led to an improvement in his symptoms. However, by fourth grade, his moodiness became more pronounced and persistent. He was generally surly, complaining that life was \"unfair.\" Wyatt and his parents began their daily limit-setting battles at breakfast while he delayed getting ready for school, and then-by evening-continued their arguments about homework, video  games, and bedtime. These arguments often included Wyatt screaming and throwing nearby objects. By the time he reached sixth grade, his parents were tired and his siblings avoided him. According to Wyatt's parents, he had no problems with appetite, and although they fought about when he would go to bed, he did not appear to have a sleep disturbance. He appeared to find pleasure in his usual activities, maintained good energy, and had no history of elation, grandiosity, or decreased need for sleep lasting more than a day. Although they described him as \"moody, isolated, and lonely,\" his parents did not see him as depressed. They denied any history of hallucinations, abuse, trauma, suicidality, homicidality, a wish to self-harm, or any premeditated wish to harm others. He and his parents denied he had ever used alcohol or drugs. His medical history was unremarkable. His family history was notable for anxiety and depression in the father, alcoholism in the paternal grandparents, and possible untreated ADHD in the mother. On interview, Wyatt was mildly anxious yet easy to engage. His body twisted back and forth as he sat in the chair. In reviewing his temper outbursts and physical aggression, Wyatt said, \"It's like I can't help myself. I don't mean to do these things. But when I get mad, I don't think about any of that. It's like my mind goes blank.\" When asked how he felt about his outbursts, Wyatt looked very sad and said earnestly, \"I hate when I'm that way.\" If he could change three things in his life, Wyatt replied, \"I would have more friends, I would do better in school, and I would stop getting mad so much.\"",
         "Discussion Wyatt's psychiatrist has referred him to an adolescent partial hospitalization program because of persistent irritability and severe recurrent temper outbursts. In assessing this 12-year-old boy, it would be important to attend to the quality, severity, frequency, and duration of the outbursts. Are they outside the range of \"developmentally normal\" children? What are the provocations? Do the outbursts occur at home, at school, with peers, or in more than one setting? How are they affecting his life? What is this boy's general mood between the outbursts? Do the outbursts reflect a lack of control over his emotional reactions, or are they a behavior calculated to achieve an intended outcome? At what age did these emotional and/or behavioral outbursts begin? Are there  corresponding neurovegetative depressive symptoms? Has he ever exhibited manic-like symptoms such as grandiosity, decreased need for sleep, pressured speech, or racing thoughts? If so, have these symptoms persisted long enough to meet criteria for a manic episode? Does he abuse substances? Has he ever experienced psychotic symptoms such as paranoia, delusions, or hallucinations of any kind? In Wyatt's case, his intense irritability appears to be persistent, while his outbursts tend to be extreme and incongruent with his overall developmental level. They are clearly interfering with all aspects of his life. He does not appear to be in control of his behavior, and his irritability and outbursts are not bringing him anything positive; in fact, the three things he says he would most like to change are specifically related to either the symptom (\"stop getting mad so much\") or the consequences of his symptoms (\"have more friends\" and \"do better in school\"). These symptoms have been worsening since grade school. He lacks prominent neurovegetative symptoms of depression, and there is no history of mania, psychosis, or substance abuse.  In considering the differential diagnosis for age-incongruent \"temper tantrums,\" it is useful to recognize that Wyatt does not manifest the decreased need for sleep, pressured speech, mood cycling, and racing thoughts that are found in bipolar disorder. In addition, his intense irritability persists between outbursts, which excludes oppositional defiant disorder, intermittent explosive disorder, and conduct disorder. Wyatt does appear to meet criteria for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD), a diagnosis introduced in DSM-5 that is listed among the depressive disorders. The core feature of DMDD is chronic, severe, persistent irritability that is incongruent with a child's developmental stage and is causing significant impairment. This core feature has two prominent clinical manifestations: frequent severe temper outbursts (verbal or behavioral) and chronic, persistently irritable or angry mood that is present between the severe temper outbursts. By DSM-5 definition, DMDD cannot coexist with bipolar disorder or with either oppositional defiant disorder or intermittent explosive disorder. If the patient has ever had a manic episode, a diagnosis of bipolar disorder supersedes a DMDD diagnosis. If the patient meets criteria for intermittent explosive disorder or oppositional defiant  disorder but also meets criteria for DMDD, the patient should only be diagnosed with DMDD. DMDD can be comorbid with a variety of other diagnoses. For example, Wyatt presents with long-standing problems with attention and anxiety. When in grade school, he was diagnosed with ADHD, combined type, which indicates that he met most criteria in both ADHD categories: attention and hyperactivity/impulsivity. Wyatt is also noted to be a chronic worrier. Although this was not explored at length in the history, he may well qualify for an anxiety disorder. It will be important to follow Wyatt longitudinally. The goal, of course, is to employ the most parsimonious diagnostic assessment and treatment plan, but these can change in the context of Wyatt's overall development. As an adolescent with a diagnosis of DMDD, he will continue to be at risk for a variety of comorbid psychiatric conditions, including other mood, anxiety, and substance use disorders.",

         "Kimberly A. Yonkers, M.D. Heather B. Howell, M.S.W. Yvonne Perez was a 23-year-old woman who presented for an outpatient psychiatric evaluation 3 weeks after giving birth to her second child. She was referred by her breastfeeding nurse, who was concerned about the patient's depressed mood, flat affect, and fatigue. Ms. Perez said she had been worried and unenthusiastic since finding out she was pregnant. She and her husband planned to wait a few years before having another child, and her husband made it clear that he would have preferred that she terminate the pregnancy, an option she would not consider because of her religion. He had also been upset that she was \"too tired\" to do paid work outside of the home during her pregnancy. She became increasingly dysphoric, hopeless, and overwhelmed after the delivery. Breastfeeding was not going well, and she began to believe her baby was \"rejecting me\" by refusing her breast, spitting up her milk, and crying. Her baby became very colicky, so she felt forced to hold him most of the day. She wondered whether she deserved this difficulty because she had not wanted the pregnancy. Her husband was gone much of the time for work, and she found it very difficult to take care of the new baby and her lively and demanding 16-month-old daughter. Over the past several weeks she slept little, felt constantly tired, cried often, and worried about how she was going to get through the day. Her mother-in-law had just arrived to help her care for the children, and she thought Ms. Perez just had the typical postpartum blues that result from \"hormones being out of whack.\" Ms. Perez was an English-speaking Hispanic woman who had worked in a coffee shop until midway through her first pregnancy, almost 2 years earlier. She was raised in a supportive home by her parents and has a large extended family. She moved to a  different region of the country when her husband was transferred for work, and she had no relatives nearby. Although no one in her family had seen a psychiatrist, several family members appeared to have been depressed. She had no prior psychiatric history or treatment. She denied illicit drug or alcohol use. She had smoked for several years but stopped when she was pregnant with her first child. Ms. Perez had a history of asthma. Aside from a multivitamin with iron, she took no medications.  On mental status examination, Ms. Perez was a casually dressed, cooperative young woman. She made some eye contact, but her eyes tended to drop to the floor when she spoke. Her speech was fluent but slow, with increased latency when answering questions. The tone of her speech was flat. She endorsed low mood, and her affect was constricted. She denied thoughts of suicide and homicide. She also denied any hallucinations and delusions, although she had considered whether the current situation was punishment for not wanting the child. She was fully oriented and could register three objects but only recalled one after 5 minutes. Her intelligence was average. Her insight and judgment were fair to good.",
         "Discussion Ms. Perez presents with low mood, poor energy and sleep, psychomotor retardation, guilt, and poor concentration. The case report does not address her appetite, her ability to find pleasure, or the presence of thoughts about death, but she clearly has more than the required five of nine symptoms to meet criteria for a DSM-5 diagnosis of a major depressive episode. Contributors include the recent delivery, a family history of depression, and multiple psychosocial stressors, including a lack of support from her husband, financial troubles, a colicky baby, and geographical distance from her family of origin. The case report is not clear, but it appears that Ms. Perez had some depressive symptoms throughout the pregnancy; she was referred to a psychiatrist at this particular time not because she was dramatically more depressed but because she was seen by a health professional, the breastfeeding nurse. This may indicate either less severe symptoms or a lack of systematic screening for depression. If Ms. Perez had become depressed only a week or so after delivery, she may not have had symptoms for the 2 weeks that are  required for a major depressive episode. In that case, adjustment disorder with depressed mood would be a more appropriate diagnosis. A postpartum onset might also increase her risk of having bipolar disorder rather than unipolar depressive disorder. Arguing against a diagnosis of bipolar disorder in this patient is the lack of any known manic or psychotic symptoms as well as the absence of a history of mood episodes or a family history of bipolar disorder. Still, the fact that she experienced precipitous worsening after delivery would increase the risk that she might develop bipolar disorder. From the available history, it appears more likely that Ms. Perez had significant depressive symptoms throughout the pregnancy. She said she felt \"worried and unenthusiastic\" and had felt \"too tired\" to work. This would not be an unusual depression trajectory, because half of women who are found to be depressed after delivery were already depressed during pregnancy. DSM-5 now includes a specifier, \"with peripartum onset,\" for women who develop a mood disorder during or soon after a pregnancy. Ms. Perez also worries that her infant is rejecting her and that her current situation is a punishment. These appear to be overvalued ideas rather than delusions, but it would be reasonable to conduct ongoing assessments for psychotic thinking.  It is also important to do a suicide risk assessment for everyone with symptoms of major depressive disorder. Ms. Perez denies such symptoms, but it would be potentially useful to explore any thoughts she might have of death, of her family being better off without her, and of her children being better off dead. The depressive subtype is important to clarify because many women with postpartum subsyndromal depressive symptoms improve spontaneously within weeks of delivery. This can occur even in the absence of formal treatment. For this reason, and because many women wish to continue breastfeeding, an initial treatment approach may be psychotherapeutic rather than pharmacological.",

         "Richard A. Friedman, M.D.  Andrew Quinn, a 60-year-old businessman, returned to see his longtime psychiatrist 2 weeks after the death of his 24-year-old son. The young man, who had struggled with major depressive disorder and substance use disorder, had been found surrounded by several emptied pill bottles and an incoherent suicide note. Mr. Quinn had been very close to his troubled son, and he immediately felt crushed, like his life had lost its meaning. In the ensuing 2 weeks, he had constant images of his son and was \"obsessed\" with how he might have prevented the substance abuse and suicide. He worried that he had been a bad father and that he had spent too much time on his own career and too little time with his son. He felt constantly sad, withdrew from his usual social life, and was unable to concentrate on his work. Although he had never previously drunk more than a few glasses of wine per week, he increased his alcohol intake to half a bottle of wine each night. At that time, his psychiatrist told him that he was struggling with grief and that such a reaction was normal. They agreed to meet for support and to assess the ongoing clinical situation.  Mr. Quinn returned to see his psychiatrist weekly. By the sixth week after the suicide, his symptoms had worsened. Instead of thinking about what he might have done differently, he became preoccupied that he should have been the one to die, not his young son. He continued to have trouble falling asleep, but he also tended to awake at 4:30 a.m. and just stare at the ceiling, feeling overwhelmed with fatigue, sadness, and feelings of  worthlessness. These symptoms improved during the day, but he also felt a persistent and uncharacteristic loss of self-confidence, sexual interest, and enthusiasm. He asked his psychiatrist whether he still had normal grief or had major depressive disorder. Mr. Quinn had a history of two prior major depressive episodes that improved with psychotherapy and antidepressant medication, but no significant depressive episodes since his 30s. He denied a history of alcohol or substance use disorders. Both of his parents had been \"depressive\" but without treatment. No one in the family had previously committed suicide.",
         "Discussion In the weeks after his son's suicide, Mr. Quinn developed sadness, insomnia, social withdrawal, diminished pleasure in activities, and poor concentration. This symptom cluster is typical of grief, recognized by both the lay public and medical professionals as a normal human reaction to the death of a loved one. At the first meeting with the psychiatrist, Mr. Quinn demonstrated multiple symptoms that are typically found in major depressive disorder (MDD), but his symptoms at that point appeared to be better conceptualized as normal bereavement. Such a view is supported by the fact that grief-despite causing distress and dysfunction-typically runs its course within 2-6 months without specific clinical attention. Grief can also evolve into a full-blown episode of MDD, especially in a patient like Mr. Quinn, who has a history of recurrent MDD. A prior version of DSM (DSM-IV) specifically acknowledged the normalcy of grief by mandating that a diagnosis of MDD be deferred for 2 months unless the clinical presentation was characterized by unusually severe symptoms such as suicidal ideation or psychosis. This so-called bereavement exclusion was included in DSM-IV for a good reason: although uncomplicated grief can be painful, it is short-lived and benign, and does not severely impair function or increase the risk of suicide as does MDD. Some people, however, do develop an autonomous mood disorder after the death of a loved one, as well as after other traumas, such as financial ruin, losses from a natural disaster, or a serious medical illness or disability. Severely distressing and causing  serious impairment, such mood syndromes warrant clinical attention prior to reaching DSM-IV's 2-month cutoff. Because of the significant symptomatic overlap between bereavement and MDD, the difficulty in predicting which symptoms will persist or intensify and which will improve on their own, and the uncertainty over what is psychologically different between the loss of a loved one and, for example, the loss of a home due to a natural disaster, there has been significant attention paid to fine-tuning the differences between MDD and bereavement. Attempting to distinguish between depression and normal grief raises a core concern in psychiatry, both from within and outside the field: what is normal? Various DSM-5 drafts were debated, and many people (including myself) worried that removal of the bereavement exclusion would medicalize normal grief and erroneously assign a psychiatric diagnosis to healthy people. In assessing depressive symptoms in the context of grief, DSM-5 suggests that Mr. Quinn's psychiatrist use her clinical judgment in differentiating between the emptiness and loss that are typical of grief and the persistently depressed mood, anhedonia, and pessimistic ruminations that are more typical of MDD. In grief, the dysphoria should gradually attenuate over weeks, though interrupted perhaps by pangs of grief that tend to focus on the deceased. The depressive symptoms of MDD are less exclusively connected to the deceased, less likely to be interrupted by positive emotions and humor, and more likely to be accompanied by self-criticism and feelings of worthlessness.  When Mr. Quinn was seen 2 weeks after his son's suicide, his psychiatrist rightly viewed his reaction as within the bounds of a normal grief reaction. At the same time, Mr. Quinn had risk factors for MDD that are often not present in people who are grieving. He has a personal history of two prior major depressive episodes, his family history is positive for depression in both parents, and his son may also have been depressed. All of these factors increase Mr. Quinn's likelihood of developing MDD in the context of the death of his son. While deferring a diagnosis of MDD, the psychiatrist continued to meet weekly with Mr. Quinn. After about 6 weeks, his symptoms had worsened, both in terms of intensity and  the development of cognitive and neurovegetative symptoms, making the diagnosis of MDD clear. The DSM-IV 2-month bereavement exclusion might have encouraged Mr. Quinn's psychiatrist to delay a diagnosis of MDD for another several weeks, until the 2- month mark had been reached. DSM-5, by contrast, did not specifically limit the use of an MDD diagnosis during the time frame between 2 weeks and 2 months. For Mr. Quinn, this shift likely means that he would more quickly receive a diagnosis of MDD under DSM-5. Experts in favor of the removal of the 2-month bereavement exclusion might be reassured by Mr. Quinn's clinical assessment. With worsening symptoms and a strong personal and family history of depression, Mr. Quinn probably warrants specific clinical attention. For most grieving people, however, their depressive symptoms do not indicate MDD. For example, a study using data from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions showed that subjects who had a bereavement-related depressive syndrome at baseline were no more likely over a 3-year follow-up period to have a major depressive episode than were those who had no lifetime history of MDD at baseline. These data confirm the widely held view that for most people, grief resolves on its own.  Nevertheless, 10%-20% of bereaved individuals go on to experience a more chronic and debilitating syndrome. DSM-5-TR addresses this complexity by adding prolonged grief disorder to the main body of the DSM text. Called persistent complex bereavement disorder in DSM-5, where it was included in Section III's \"Conditions for Further Study,\" DSM-5-TR's prolonged grief disorder is characterized by a cluster of dysfunctional reactions to the death of a loved one at least 12 months earlier. The reaction is characterized by an intense longing for the loved one and/or a disturbing preoccupation with the deceased. In addition, the patient should manifest at least three of eight symptom clusters that are referable to the death: identity disruption, a sense of disbelief about the death, avoidance of reminders of the death, intense emotional pain, difficulty reintegrating into relationships, emotional numbness, a sense of meaninglessness, and loneliness. In addition, this cluster of reactions must have occurred more days than not since the loved one's death and almost every day for the month leading up to the evaluation. The clinician must also link the symptoms with the  loss of the loved one, so that the symptoms (such as identity disruption or loneliness) are not better explained by a different disorder, such as MDD. Whether one is evaluating someone who is suffering acutely, like Mr. Quinn, or someone who is still suffering a year or more after a loss, DSM-5-TR urges clinicians to use their judgment when trying to distinguish between clinical depression and grief. A reasonable argument could be made for treating the patient for MDD in equivocal cases, especially if the patient appears to fulfill requirements for MDD. It remains to be seen whether these changes will help identify patients who warrant clinical attention-or will encourage the medicalization of grief. In the meantime, clinicians should continue to recognize that although grief can sometimes trigger MDD, grief itself is an entirely normal emotional response to loss that requires no psychiatric intervention.",

         "Anthony J. Rothschild, M.D.  Barbara Reiss was a 51-year-old white woman who was brought to the emergency room by her husband with the chief complaint \"I feel like killing myself.\" Ms. Reiss had begun to \"lose interest in life\" about 4 months earlier. During that time, she reported depression every day for most of the day. Symptoms had been worsening for months. She had lost 9 lb (current weight 105 lb) without dieting because she did not feel like eating. She had trouble falling asleep almost every night and woke at 3:00 a.m. several mornings per week (she normally woke at 6:30 a.m.). She had diminished energy, concentration, and ability to perform her administrative job at a dog food processing plant. She was convinced that she had made a mistake that would lead to the deaths of thousands of dogs. She expected that she would soon be arrested, and would rather kill herself than go to prison.  Her primary care physician had recognized the patient's depressed mood 1 week earlier and had prescribed sertraline and referred her for a psychiatric evaluation. Ms. Reiss denied a previous psychiatric history. One sister suffered from depression. Ms. Reiss denied any history of hypomania or mania. She typically drank a glass of wine with dinner and had started drinking a second glass before bed in hopes of getting a night's sleep. She had been married to her husband for 20 years, and they had three school-age children. She had been employed with her current company for 13 years. She denied illicit drug use. The physical examination performed by the primary care physician 1 week earlier was noncontributory. All laboratory testing was normal, including complete blood count, electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, calcium, glucose, thyroid function tests, folate, and vitamin B12. On mental status examination, Ms. Reiss was cooperative and exhibited psychomotor agitation. She answered most questions with short answers, often simply saying \"yes\" or \"no.\" Speech was of a normal rate and tone, without tangentiality or circumstantiality. She denied having hallucinations or unusual thoughts. She described the mistakes she believed she had made at work and insisted that she would soon be arrested for the  deaths of dogs, but she insisted this was all true and not \"a delusion.\" Recent and remote memory were grossly intact.",
         "Discussion Ms. Reiss exhibits all nine of the symptomatic criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD): depressed mood, loss of interest or pleasure, weight loss, insomnia, psychomotor agitation, loss of energy, excessive guilt, trouble concentrating, and thoughts of death. Only five are necessary for a DSM-5 MDD diagnosis. Before a depressive disorder diagnosis is made, a medical cause should be ruled out. A recent medical examination was noncontributory, and there is no indication that Ms. Reiss even has a medical comorbidity, much less one that could cause a depression. It is also important to explore the possibility of bipolar disorder. The case report makes no mention of such symptoms as pressured speech or risk taking, but manic symptoms can sometimes be missed, and a bipolar disorder diagnosis would significantly affect treatment. The patient reports two nightly glasses of wine, which is unlikely to be contributory. If she is significantly underestimating her alcohol intake, however, she would be at risk for alcohol-induced depressive disorder. Multiple medications and substances of abuse can also cause serious depression and psychosis. Collateral history might be helpful, as would a toxicology screen.  Ms. Reiss also exhibits psychotic symptoms (delusions) in the context of MDD. New to DSM-5 was the separation of psychotic features from the MDD severity rating. In other words, MDD with psychotic features is not inevitably considered \"severe.\" This has not changed in DSM-5-TR. Ms. Reiss's psychotic symptoms would be classified as mood congruent because the content of her delusions is consistent with the typical depressive themes of inadequacy, guilt, disease, death, nihilism, or deserved punishment. Psychotic features often can be missed in MDD. Although Ms. Reiss's delusions about killing dogs appear to have been spontaneously reported and are unlikely to be true, many patients are more guarded and will not easily give up such information. Furthermore, fixed, false beliefs that are not bizarre can sound reasonable to the clinician. One way to approach this issue with patients is to avoid the use of words such as psychosis or delusional and instead to ask patients about their \"irrational worries.\"  Clinicians may also find the Psychotic Depression Assessment Scale (PDAS; https:// psychoticdepressionassessmentscale.com) to be a useful tool for the assessment of patients with MDD with psychotic features.",

         "This case is dedicated to the memory of James S. Jackson, Ph.D., in recognition of his leadership of research on the mental health of Black Americans. Cheryl C. Munday, Ph.D. Jamie Miller Abelson, M.S.W. Crystal Smith, a 33-year-old African American homemaker, came to an outpatient clinic seeking \"someone to talk to\" about feelings of despair that had intensified over the previous 8-10 months. She was particularly upset about marital conflict and an uncharacteristic irritability with her mother-in-law. Ms. Smith said she had begun to wake before dawn, feeling down and tearful. She had  difficulty getting out of bed and completing her usual household activities. At times, she felt guilty for not being her \"usual self.\" At other times, she became easily irritated with her husband and impatient with her mother-in-law for minor transgressions. She relied on her mother-in-law for assistance with her children, but recently her mother-in-law appeared to be less available. Ms. Smith worries that she has become a burden to her mother-in-law. Her related guilt, in combination with her insomnia and fatigue, have made it very difficult for Ms. Smith to get her children to school on time. In the past few months, she had lost 13 pounds without dieting. She denied current suicidal ideation, saying she \"would never do something like that,\" but acknowledged having thought that she \"should just give up\" and that she \"would be better off dead.\" She decided to make an appointment after she attended her good friend's wedding and found she did not enjoy any of it.  Two months previously, Ms. Smith had seen a psychiatrist for several weeks and received fluoxetine. She reluctantly gave it a try, discontinuing it quickly because it made her feel even more tired. She had also dropped out of therapy, indicating that the psychiatrist did not seem to understand her. Ms. Smith lived with her husband of 13 years and two school-age children. Her husband's parents lived next door. She said her marriage was good, although her husband suggested she \"go see someone\" so that she would not be \"pacing and yelling at everyone all the time.\" While historically sociable, she now rarely talked to her own mother and sisters, much less her friends. Previously a regular churchgoer, she had quit attending because she felt her faith was \"weak.\" Her pastor had always been supportive, but she had not contacted him with her problems because \"he wouldn't want to hear about these kinds of issues.\" Ms. Smith described herself as having been an outgoing, friendly child. She grew up with her parents and three siblings. She recalled feeling quite upset at age 10-11 when her parents divorced and her mom remarried. Because of fights with other kids at school, she met with a school counselor with whom she felt a bond. Unlike the psychiatrist she had recently consulted, Ms. Smith felt the counselor did not \"get into my business\" and helped her recover. She said she became quieter as she entered junior high school, with fewer friends and little interest in studying. She married her husband at age 20 and  worked in retail sales until the birth of their first child when she was 23 years old.  Ms. Smith had not used alcohol since her first pregnancy, and she denied any use of illicit substances. She also denied past and current use of prescribed medications, other than the brief trial of the antidepressant medication. She reported generally good health. On mental status examination, Ms. Smith was a casually groomed young woman who was coherent and goal directed. She had difficulty making eye contact with the white middle-aged therapist. She was cooperative but mildly guarded and slow to respond. She needed encouragement to elaborate her thinking. She was periodically tearful and generally appeared sad. She denied confusion, psychosis, hallucinations, current suicidal ideation, and homicidality. Cognition, insight, and judgment were all considered normal.",
         "Discussion Ms. Smith presents with 8-10 months of a persistently depressed mood, anhedonia, poor sleep, diminished appetite with weight loss, anergia, psychomotor agitation, and thoughts of death. She easily meets the requirement of five of nine symptom criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD). There is no evidence that the symptoms are caused by a substance or another medical condition. She is distressed and dysfunctional to an extent that warrants clinical attention. She therefore meets criteria for DSM-5 MDD. In addition, Ms. Smith has classic melancholic features: she reports loss of pleasure in almost all activities, describes a distinct quality of depressed mood (characterized by profound despondency or despair), is regularly worse in the morning, has had significant weight loss, and is reportedly motorically agitated.  Ms. Smith's irritability is prominent. Irritability may be more readily endorsed than sadness, especially by African Americans, among whom psychiatric stigma is high. Although a complaint of irritability can be part of mania or hypomania, Ms. Smith lacks other symptoms of mania. Further exploration of her guilty feelings would help determine whether they are excessive. Many African American women expect to function as a steadfast maternal figure with strong religious faith, a culturally normative gender role, and they might be more likely to present with excessive fatigue rather than a complaint of depression.  An important depression specifier is whether the MDD is a single episode or recurrent. It is not clear whether Ms. Smith had MDD after her parents' divorce when she was a child. To clarify, the clinician should explore further those long-ago symptoms. She was referred to a school counselor at that time because of irritability and fights with classmates, but underlying depressive thoughts and feelings associated with her parents' divorce would be consistent with a mood disorder. Knowledge of her parents' divorce might have helped teachers recognize that she was experiencing depressive symptoms, but it would not have been unusual for her to have been labeled \"impulsive and disruptive\" rather than seen as a depressed young girl who needed help.  Although she had been willing to seek professional help, Ms. Smith has had a mixed experience with mental health care professionals. She felt a bond with her school counselor, noting that the therapist did not \"get into her business\" but did help her recover. More recently, she had quickly dropped out of mental health care treatment because the psychiatrist \"did not understand her,\" and the antidepressant medication made her \"tired.\" At the time of the evaluation, Ms. Smith is noted (by the self-described middle-aged white therapist) as guarded and having difficulty making eye contact. More information would be needed, and it is common for people with depression to not feel an alliance or to discontinue recommended medication.  Nevertheless, Ms. Smith's evaluation and treatment may be getting derailed by cultural issues. Race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and gender are increasingly being realized as affecting the development of a therapeutic alliance, an accurate diagnosis, and a workable therapeutic plan. Furthermore, lower use of mental health care services by African Americans and delays in seeking treatment may contribute to illness persistence. Use of the revised DSM-5-TR Core Cultural Formulation Interview might facilitate more sensitive communication between clinician and patient and enhance the clinician's understanding of the patient's personal narrative. Ms. Smith's outcome may depend on her therapist's ability and willingness to tactfully address the cultural issues that are likely to be affecting Ms. Smith's depression and her course of treatment.",

         "Benjamin Brody, M.D.  Diane Taylor, a 35-year-old laboratory technician, was referred to the outpatient psychiatry department of an academic medical center by the employee assistance program (EAP) of her employer, a major pharmaceutical company. Her supervisor had referred Ms. Taylor to the EAP after she had become tearful while being mildly criticized during an otherwise positive annual performance review. Somewhat embarrassed, she told the consulting psychiatrist that she had been \"feeling low for years\" and that hearing  criticism of her work had been \"just too much.\"  A native of western Canada, Ms. Taylor came to the United States to pursue graduate studies in chemistry. She left graduate school before completing her doctorate and began work as a laboratory technician. She reported feeling frustrated with her job, which she saw as a \"dead end,\" yet feared that she lacked the talent to find more satisfying work. As a result, she struggled with guilty feelings that she \"hadn't done much\" with her life. Despite her troubles at work, Ms. Taylor felt that she could concentrate without difficulty. She denied ever having active suicidal thoughts, yet sometimes wondered, \"What is the point of life?\" When asked, she reported that she occasionally had trouble falling asleep. However, she denied any change in her weight or appetite. Although she occasionally would go out with coworkers, she said that she felt shy and awkward in social situations unless she knew the people well. She did enjoy jogging and the outdoors. Although her romantic relationships tended to \"not last long,\" she felt that her sex drive was normal. She noted that her symptoms waxed and waned but had remained consistent over the past 3 years. She had no symptoms suggestive of mania or hypomania.  Ms. Taylor was an only child. Growing up, she had a close relationship with her father, a pharmacist who owned a drugstore. She described him as a \"normal guy who liked to hunt and fish\" and liked to take her hiking. Her mother, a nurse, stopped working shortly after giving birth and had seemed emotionally distant and depressed. Ms. Taylor became depressed for the first time in high school when her father was repeatedly hospitalized after developing leukemia. At that time she was treated with psychotherapy and responded well. She had no other psychiatric or medical history, and her medications were a multivitamin and oral contraceptives. When offered several different treatments, she expressed a preference for a combination of medication and psychotherapy. She started taking citalopram and began a course of supportive psychotherapy. After several months of treatment, she revealed that she had been sexually abused by a family friend during her childhood. It also emerged that she had few women friends and a persistent pattern of dysfunctional and occasionally abusive relationships with men.",
         "Discussion\t It has long been recognized that depressive illnesses are not always episodic, and a significant minority of patients suffer from chronic forms of depression with varying degrees of severity. Early versions of DSM characterized mild, chronic depression as a personality disorder. In DSM-III, however, the milder form of chronic depression was introduced as an affective illness called dysthymic disorder. That move reflected a growing body of research suggesting that the condition can respond to antidepressant medication, but the move was controversial. Do these patients feel dysphoric because of their chronic social dysfunction, occupational difficulties, and negative cognitive styles? Alternatively, does their chronic underlying depression lead to an atrophy of their relationships and interpersonal skills and a selective attentional bias to negative life events? Debate about the nature and validity of the diagnosis persists.  When first conceptualized in DSM-III, dysthymia was described as being a less severe but more chronic variant of acute major depressive disorder (MDD). Evidence accumulated, however, that \"pure\" dysthymia (i.e., persistent mild depression without episodes of MDD) was uncommon. This led to the description of a spectrum of chronic depressive syndromes, of which dysthymia was the most mild. Slightly more severe was \"double depression,\" or a major depressive episode superimposed on a baseline dysthymic state. The next most severe involved two or more major depressive episodes bridged by periods of incomplete improvement. Two years of symptoms severe enough to meet full criteria for MDD represented the most severe form. In practice, many patients found it difficult to recall their symptom fluctuations well enough to make these distinctions meaningful. DSM-5-TR now aggregates contemporary descriptions of these patterns as specifiers under the diagnosis persistent depressive disorder.  Does Ms. Taylor meet the criteria for this DSM-5-TR diagnosis? She has certainly had chronic symptoms. Despite significant occupational and interpersonal impairment, she endorses psychological but not neurovegetative symptoms of depression, which fall below the threshold for MDD. However, whether that has consistently been the case over the past 2 years is difficult to tell. It is possible, for example, that although Ms. Taylor denied difficulty concentrating at the time of evaluation, her employers may have felt otherwise at times in the past. The criteria allow for the possibility that although she may  have slipped into MDD at times, the current diagnosis is still persistent depressive disorder. The interplay of affective illness, childhood trauma history, and personality also emerges from Ms. Taylor's story. She manifests personality traits (withdrawal, restricted affectivity, intimacy avoidance, and sensitivity to criticism) that shape how she sees the world. These traits can perpetuate her depressive symptoms and offer important clues for treatment. Her history of childhood abuse, for example, suggests a need for combination therapy that will likely be more effective than psychotherapy or antidepressant medication alone. Regardless of whether Ms. Taylor meets criteria for a comorbid avoidant personality disorder, her avoidant personality traits are liable to complicate treatment and portend a poor outcome. Alternatively, these dysfunctional personality traits may improve with resolution of her persistent depressive symptoms.",

         "Margaret Altemus, M.D.  Emma Wang, a 26-year-old investment banker, referred herself to an outpatient psychiatrist because of \"mood swings\" that were ruining her relationship with her boyfriend. She said their latest argument was triggered by his being slightly late for a date. She had yelled at him and then, out of the blue, ended the relationship. She felt despondent afterward, guilty and self-critical. When she called him to make up, he had refused, saying he was tired of her \"PMS [premenstrual syndrome] explosions.\" She had then cut herself superficially on her left forearm, which she had found to be a reliable method to reduce anxiety since she was a young teenager. She said these mood swings came out of the blue every month and that they featured tension, argumentativeness, anxiety, sadness, and regret. Sometimes she yelled at her boyfriend, but she also got upset with friends, work, and her family. During the week in which she was \"Mr. Hyde,\" she avoided socializing or talking on the phone; she wouldn't be her \"usual fun self,\" she said, and would alienate her friends. She was able to work when she felt \"miserable,\" but she did have relatively poor energy and concentration. She was also edgy and \"self-pitying\" and regretful that she had chosen to \"waste\" her youth working so hard for an uncaring financial institution.  When she was feeling \"desperate,\" she would be determined to seek treatment. Soon after the onset of her period, however, she would improve dramatically, return to her old self, and not find the time to see a psychiatrist. During the several weeks after her period, she said she felt \"fine, terrific, the usual.\" She said the mood swings always started 7-10 days before the start of her menstrual period, \"like terrible PMS.\" Her periods were regular. She had premenstrual breast tenderness, bloating, increased appetite, and weight gain. Almost as soon as her period began, she felt \"suddenly good.\" She denied alcohol or illicit substance use and had no history of psychotic, manic, or obsessional symptoms. She denied any suicidal thoughts and any prior suicide attempts and psychiatric hospitalizations. She denied allergies and medical problems. She took one medication, her birth control pill. Her family history was pertinent for a mother with possible depression. Ms. Wang was born in Taiwan and came to the United States at age 14 to attend boarding school. After graduating from an  elite business school, she had moved in with her older sister.  On mental status examination, Ms. Wang was a fashionably dressed East Asian woman wearing tasteful jewelry and carrying a designer bag. Her hair was slightly askew. She maintained good eye contact and was pleasant and cooperative throughout the interview. Her speech was normal in rate, rhythm, and volume. She described her mood as \"generally good,\" and her affect was full, reactive, and mildly irritable. Her thought process was linear, and she showed no evidence of delusions, obsessions, or hallucinations. She denied suicidal and homicidal ideation. Her insight, judgment, and impulse control were intact, although she noted a history of perimenstrual impairment in these areas.",
         "Discussion Ms. Wang presents with mood swings, irritability, nonsuicidal self-injury (cutting), interpersonal instability, anxiety, sadness, social withdrawal, diminished concentration and energy, and anhedonia. She also describes physical symptoms such as increased appetite, clumsiness, fatigue, and bloating. These symptoms are severe enough to impair her social relationships and her function at work. This history could fit a number of psychiatric disorders, but Ms. Wang also indicates that these symptoms occur only during a circumscribed time before the onset of her menses. At other times of the month, she is upbeat, energetic, and optimistic. Disappearance of symptoms after onset of menses is key to the diagnosis of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). Ms. Wang reports 7-10 days of symptoms premenstrually, which is on the longer end of the spectrum of symptom duration for PMDD. Some women have symptoms starting at ovulation and lasting for 2 weeks, but a shorter duration of symptoms is more common. Among women with premenstrual symptoms, the most symptomatic days, averaging across all women, are the 4 days preceding and the 2 days following onset of menses. Ms. Wang's cutting behavior is not typical of PMDD. Impaired impulse control suggests borderline traits in addition to PMDD symptoms. Comorbid disorders do not exclude the diagnosis of PMDD. Many psychiatric disorders have exacerbations during the  premenstrual period, but in such cases the patient does not return to her normal self after the menstrual period begins. Ms. Wang suggests that she has \"PMS,\" or premenstrual syndrome, which is a medical condition but not a DSM-5 diagnosis. Criteria for PMS tend to be less rigorous than for PMDD and do not require an affective component. PMDD is not associated with abnormalities in circulating levels of estrogen or progesterone. Instead, women with PMDD seem to be more sensitive to normal luteal hormone fluctuations. Hormone blood levels are, therefore, not part of the diagnostic evaluation. Although hormonal contraceptives might be expected to help with symptoms, women taking oral contraceptives often continue to have premenstrual mood symptoms (as seen in Ms. Wang). One component that is crucial in making the PMDD diagnosis is an accurate longitudinal history. Retrospective symptom reports are often inaccurate throughout psychiatry, and that is true for premenstrual symptoms. Validated scales are available for assessing PMDD, such as the Daily Record of Severity of Problems. At this early stage of evaluation, DSM-5 would indicate that Ms. Wang has a provisional diagnosis of PMDD. Only after she has recorded symptoms over two menstrual cycles could she be said to have DSM-5 PMDD.",

         "Edward V. Nunes, M.D.  Frank Young, a 40-year-old business executive, was brought for a psychiatric consultation by his wife. While Mr. Young sat quietly beside her, she reported that a change had come over him during the last 6 months. He was either quiet and withdrawn or uncharacteristically irritable. He had begun to drink alcohol to excess in social situations, sometimes embarrassing her. He often came home late, or not at all, claiming to have been at the office. When away from home, he rarely answered phone calls and text messages. She wondered if he was having an affair. Mr. Young denied seeing anyone else and indicated he had just been having a hard time. After his wife left the psychiatrist's office, Mr. Young reported a great deal of stress at work over the last year as he tried to deal with industry-wide setbacks and personal financial losses. He said he felt down and depressed most of the time. He reported difficulty sleeping most nights, loss of interest in his wife and children, low energy, and feelings of failure and self-criticism. He had frequent thoughts of wanting to be dead and of suicide, but he denied any suicidal intent or plans. When asked about the alcohol, he acknowledged that he had been drinking heavily for at least 6 months. When asked about other substances, he asked about therapeutic confidentiality and then acknowledged that he had been using cocaine several times per week for about 9 months. He kept his cocaine use from his wife because he knew she would be judgmental. In the beginning, cocaine put him in a reliably positive, optimistic mood, and he found that he could more successfully churn through large volumes of otherwise tedious and discouraging work. Although his work required some socializing in the evening, he also began to regularly go to bars in the evening just so that he would have a place to comfortably combine cocaine with alcohol. He craved the high from cocaine, went out of his way to obtain it, and spent a lot of time getting high that he would previously have been spending with his family.  When asked to clarify the sequence of work stress, cocaine use, and depression  symptoms, he reported that he had felt worried and discouraged about work for a year, but the feelings of depression, loss of interest, irritability, insomnia, and low self-esteem had not begun until about 6 months earlier, 3 months after he had begun to use cocaine regularly. He experienced those depressive symptoms most of the day every day, whether or not he had taken cocaine within the last several days. Mr. Young denied any previous episodes of depression, other mood or anxiety disorders, or suicide attempts. He drank socially. He had experimented with cannabis and cocaine as a teenager but had never developed a pattern of regular use or impairment until the past year.",
         "Discussion Mr. Young has significant depression. He meets criteria for cocaine use disorder of at least moderate severity and may also have an alcohol use disorder. He also has significant work stress and appears to be in a tense marriage. The relationships between his mood, his substance use, and his stress are complicated but crucial to the development of an effective treatment strategy. The first difficulty in evaluating substance use disorders is getting an accurate history about behaviors that are often embarrassing and illegal. Mr. Young was quite forthcoming about his cocaine use, but only after he was specifically asked about alcohol and substance use. Waiting for patients to spontaneously report illicit substance use is likely to lead to not getting the information. This is problematic given that substance use is widespread and frequently co-occurs with other psychiatric disorders. An empathic, nonjudgmental interviewing style will usually help the patient open up. In other words, asking about alcohol and common drugs of abuse with a matter-of-fact attitude indicates to the patient that his or her answers will not be surprising and will provide information that can improve the treatment. As seen with Mr. Young, family members are often the ones to bring a substance use disorder patient to consultation. They can be important allies in clarifying the symptoms and implementing a treatment plan. Mr. Young needed time alone with the clinician to tell his story, but it was very useful to hear his wife's observations.  A careful exploration of the history can help differentiate between diagnoses that are  associated with similar symptoms. Cocaine withdrawal typically causes depressive symptoms, for example, as do major depressive disorder (MDD) and cocaine-induced depressive disorder. One important differentiating factor is the temporal relationship between symptoms and the use of the substances. According to DSM-5, an independent MDD would be diagnosed if the depression began before the onset of substance use disorder or persisted for a substantial period of time beyond cessation of substance use. The amount of time is left to the clinician's judgment, but about 1 month is suggested. MDD would also be diagnosed if the involved substance was deemed unlikely to cause a depressive syndrome or if the patient had previously experienced recurrent non-substance-induced major depressive episodes. Mr. Young had never had a major depressive episode until after he started using cocaine, and there has not been a substantial abstinent period since; thus, independent MDD cannot be diagnosed.  It is also important to consider the possibility that Mr. Young's symptoms are the direct result of intoxication and/or withdrawal. Intoxication with and withdrawal from cocaine and alcohol can cause depressed mood and sleep disturbance, but symptoms would be expected to resolve within a day or two of the last use. Mr. Young's depression and insomnia persist, regardless of the timing of his last use. In addition, other depressive symptoms such as suicidal ideation are not typically part of intoxication or withdrawal. Mr. Young, therefore, is diagnosed with a substance-induced depressive disorder, which is linked to depressions that appear to have been induced by the ongoing use of a substance and that seem to have taken on a life of their own. If Mr. Young's depression persists after a month of abstinence, his diagnosis would shift to MDD, although the clinician would likely consider the cocaine to have triggered the depression. It is useful to identify substance-induced depressive disorder. Compared with independent MDD, substance-induced depressive disorder is associated with an increased suicide risk. Furthermore, the additional depression diagnosis reduces the likelihood that someone with a substance use disorder will achieve abstinence. Substance-induced depressive disorder should be kept on a patient's list of diagnoses and followed carefully.",

         "Thomas W. Meeks, M.D.  George Anderson, a 73-year-old married man, was referred to a psychiatrist for an evaluation of depression after screening positive on the Geriatric Depression Scale during a neurology appointment. For most of the 2 years since his diagnosis with Parkinson's disease, Mr. Anderson had coped well and continued to engage in many of his usual activities. His wife of 49 years noted that 1-2 years before developing Parkinson's disease, Mr. Anderson had become somewhat less enthusiastic and motivated compared with his baseline personality, but not to the point of causing any concern or impairment. The only other neuropsychiatric symptom preceding his Parkinson's diagnosis was his wife's report that during the past 5 years he frequently \"thrashed about\" while asleep.  Three months prior to the referral, however, Mr. Anderson began to decline social invitations from family and friends. He reported that he had withdrawn socially because he had lost pleasure in things that used to excite him, although he denied persistent feelings of sadness or worry. He recognized that he was not his \"usual self\" and tried, to no avail, to give himself \"pep talks.\" He had worked as a high school science teacher until retirement at age 67, and reported having learned \"the power of seeing the glass half full\" from his students. He felt frustrated that he could not \"snap out of it\" for the first time in his life but was hopeful about getting professional help. He denied wishing for death, explaining that although he was not afraid of death, he wanted to enjoy life as long as possible. He added, \"God does not give me more than I can handle. I can't ask for a better family, and I have had a full life.\"  Other new symptoms over the prior few months included increasing fatigue, impaired concentration and memory, unintentional weight loss, and sleep-onset insomnia. Further history on his more chronic sleep symptoms revealed that, around 3:00 a.m. or 4:00 a.m. on most nights, Mr. Anderson began violently moving his extremities and moaning as though in distress, all while still seemingly asleep in bed. He often awakened his wife with these movements and occasionally struck her in his sleep. She sometimes used a different bedroom because of this. When he awoke from such an incident, he was coherent and briefly anxious, often reporting that he had been dreaming of swimming or running from something. His wife took over driving shortly after his Parkinson's disease diagnosis, but Mr. Anderson was otherwise independent in activities of daily living such as paying bills and managing his medications. His wife described him as \"maybe a little more forgetful\" over the past few years, but neither of them was concerned about this mild memory loss. Past medical history included prostate cancer (in remission), glaucoma, and gout. Labs from his recent neurology visit were unremarkable, including blood counts, serum chemistries, thyroid function, and vitamin B12 levels. Family psychiatric history was positive only for a granddaughter with ADHD. He denied past problematic substance use and all current substance use except two or three glasses of wine monthly. He denied any previous depressive episodes, psychiatric treatment, or psychiatric evaluations.  On mental status examination, Mr. Anderson was pleasant, cooperative, and interpersonally engaging. Resting tremor, shuffling gait, hypophonia, and bradykinesia all were evident at mild to moderate levels. He occasionally smiled, but his affect was difficult to fully gauge because of masked facies. He reported his mood as \"blah.\" There was no evidence of psychosis. On cognitive testing, he had some difficulty on the Trail Making Test part B, figure copying, and word-list recall, the latter being helped by category prompts. On a standardized brief cognitive assessment, he scored 25 out of 30 points, which was in the normal range.",
         "Discussion Although Mr. Anderson denies sad mood, he does have evidence of anhedonia along with five other depressive symptoms (weight loss, insomnia, fatigue, poor concentration, and psychomotor retardation), all for longer than 2 weeks. These symptoms are distressing to him and are significantly impacting his social functioning. This could indicate major depressive disorder (MDD). However, Mr. Anderson has no personal or family history of depression, an atypically late age at symptom onset, and symptom development exclusively during the course of Parkinson's disease. When depressive symptoms are temporally associated with the onset or progression of another medical condition, and are not explained by delirium, the DSM-5 diagnosis \"depressive disorder due to another medical condition\" should be considered. This diagnosis is intended for situations in which the direct physiological effects of another medical condition (e.g., effects of insufficient thyroid hormones on the brain) cause depressive symptoms. This diagnosis is not intended to describe individuals whose symptoms arise from a psychological reaction to illness. In Mr. Anderson's case, adjustment disorder with depressed mood may be a more appropriate diagnosis. These two possible etiologies of depressive symptoms (physiological vs. psychological) among persons with another medical condition are difficult to fully delineate from one another and may coexist. There are, however, many cases in which the evidence suggests one condition substantially more than the other.  Clinically significant depressive symptoms occur in up to half of persons with  Parkinson's disease and may occur throughout the disease course. Depressive symptoms have been linked with neurobiological changes observed in Parkinson's disease, such as dysregulation and neuronal loss in monoamine pathways that are implicated in development of MDD. Yet Parkinson's-associated depression also appears distinct from MDD, with differing patterns of treatment response to antidepressants. In addition, Parkinson's disease tends to feature more prominent apathy/anhedonia than is seen in MDD, which may reflect the dopamine depletion that is the principal pathology of Parkinson's disease.  Depressive symptoms in Parkinson's disease do not consistently correlate with the severity of motor impairment or disability and often somewhat predate awareness of motor symptoms. These findings, together with Mr. Anderson's historical resiliency and positive coping style, suggest that a physiological explanation is more likely than a psychological one. In other words, depressive disorder due to another medical condition is a more appropriate diagnosis than adjustment disorder. If the criteria for symptom duration and number are met for MDD, the specifier \"with major depressive-like episode\" should be added to the diagnosis. Because symptoms from a nonpsychiatric medical illness can overlap with depressive symptoms, diagnostic ambiguity may arise. For instance, persons with Parkinson's disease may experience symptoms such as fatigue, psychomotor retardation, sleep disturbance, cognitive impairment, and weight loss independent of depressed mood or anhedonia. However, in Mr. Anderson's case, these symptoms developed or worsened in conjunction with his newly disabling anhedonia, which suggests that criteria for a major depressive episode are met, except for the probable causation by another medical condition.  As often occurs in Parkinson's disease, Mr. Anderson has a sleep disturbance consistent with rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder. This sleep disorder is characterized by \"repeated episodes of arousal during sleep associated with vocalization and/or complex motor behaviors\" that may result in \"injury to self or the bed partner.\" Upon awakening, affected persons typically have a clear sensorium and a sense of having \"acted out\" their dreams. Polysomnography would reveal absence of atonia during REM sleep but would not be required in order to make the diagnosis in the context of a synucleinopathy such as Parkinson's disease. Symptoms typically occur 90 minutes or  more into sleep and more often in the second half of the night, when REM sleep density increases. Although Mr. Anderson's history (including onset of sleep disturbance prior to Parkinson's disease symptoms) is consistent with REM sleep behavior disorder, his new initial insomnia is not explained by this diagnosis and is more likely related to his depressive disorder. Cognitive changes, particularly impairments of visuospatial, executive, and memory retrieval functions, often develop and gradually progress in Parkinson's disease. Mr. Anderson's cognitive test results are typical of such cognitive changes, but his new-onset subjective difficulty with concentration is more likely secondary to depression. His cognitive problems are mild and not overtly impairing. Available information does not clearly indicate that a neurocognitive disorder is present, although neuropsychological testing and prospective monitoring of cognition should be considered, given that at least 30% of persons with Parkinson's disease develop an associated major neurocognitive disorder.  In addition to meeting criteria for two DSM-5 disorders, Mr. Anderson displays evidence of resilience, wisdom, and other signs of psychological health. He demonstrates positive coping skills (e.g., cognitive reframing, use of social supports) and long-term supportive relationships, spirituality, gratitude, optimism, and developmentally appropriate ego integrity, including a realistic yet nonmorbid perspective about personal mortality. Unfortunately, even individuals with few risk factors for depression and evidence of lifelong healthy psychological functioning are not immune to the neuropsychiatric effects of certain medical conditions.",

         "Joseph F. Goldberg, M.D.  Helena Bates was a 27-year-old single administrative assistant who presented for a psychiatric evaluation and treatment for depression. She had recently begun an intensive outpatient program after a first lifetime hospitalization for an impulsive overdose following the breakup of a 2-year relationship. She said she had been feeling increasingly sad and hopeless for 1-2 months prior to the breakup. About a month before her admission, she began seeing a new psychotherapist who told her she had \"borderline traits\" and \"situational mood swings.\" During these 4-8 weeks, Ms. Bates's mood had been moderately depressed throughout the day most days, with no diurnal variation and intact mood reactivity. She had recently gained about 10 pounds from \"overeating comfort food and junk.\" She denied prominent irritability or argumentativeness. She described her self-esteem as \"none\" and had found it hard to feel motivation or to concentrate on routine tasks. By contrast, sometimes she would have \"bursts\" of nonstop thinking about her estranged boyfriend and devising ways to \"get him back,\" alternating with \"grieving his loss.\" She described times of being  flooded with strategies to regain his interest (including purchasing a full-page newspaper \"open letter\" to him) and recently found herself awake until 5:00 or 6:00 a.m. journaling or calling friends in the middle of the night \"for support.\" She would then \"trudge through the day\" without fatigue after only 2-3 hours of sleep. These symptoms began prior to her hospitalization. She denied drug or alcohol misuse and self-injurious behavior. Until this particular breakup, she denied a history of particularly intense or chaotic relationships, as well as a history of suicidal thoughts or gestures. Indeed, Ms. Bates seemed horrified by her own impulsive overdose.  Previously, Ms. Bates had seen a counselor in high school for \"moodiness\" and poor grades. She became \"depressed\" in college. At that time, she began escitalopram and psychotherapy, but improved quickly and stopped both after a few weeks. While in the hospital following her suicide attempt, she started taking vilazodone and quetiapine at bedtime \"for sleep.\" Ms. Bates was the youngest of three children who grew up in a middle-class suburban home. She attended public school and a state college as \"mostly a B student\" and hoped to someday go to law school. She described herself as having been a \"quiet, anxious\" child and \"not a troublemaker.\" Her older brother abused multiple substances, although Ms. Bates said she herself had never used illicit substances. Her older sister was treated for \"panic attacks and depression,\" and Ms. Bates knew of several aunts and cousins whom she thought were \"depressed.\" On examination, Ms. Bates was a pleasant, well-related, casually but appropriately dressed, moderately overweight woman, appearing her stated age, who made good eye contact. Her speech was somewhat rapid and verbose but interruptible and nonpressured. She had no abnormal motor movements, but she gestured dramatically and with excessive animation. Her mood was depressed, and her affect was tense and dysphoric but with full range and normal responsivity. Ms. Bates's thought processes were somewhat circumstantial but generally coherent, linear, and logical. Her thought content was notable for passive thoughts that she might be better off dead, but without intent or plan; she had no delusions, hallucinations, or homicidal thoughts. Her higher integrative functioning was grossly intact, as were her insight and judgment.",
         "Discussion\t Ms. Bates meets DSM-5 criteria for a major depressive episode, manifesting pervasive depressed mood with at least five associated features (suicidal thoughts, poor concentration, low self-esteem, hyperphagia, and psychomotor agitation). She also describes several symptoms consistent with mania or hypomania: a decreased need for sleep with nocturnal hyperactivity and no consequent next-day fatigue, probable racing thoughts, and rapid, verbose speech (as noted on interview). Although the examiner deemed Ms. Bates's insight and judgment globally intact at the time of the interview, some of her recent thoughts (e.g., posting an open letter in a newspaper) and actions (calling friends in the middle of the night) suggest impaired judgment involving behaviors with the potential for painful consequences.  Although Ms. Bates does have some manic symptoms, she does not meet DSM-5 requirements for a diagnosis of mania or hypomania. She would be said to have subsyndromal hypomania along with the syndromal depression. This combination qualifies her for the DSM-5-TR diagnosis of major depressive disorder with mixed features (MDD-MF). Previously, \"mixed features\" applied only to bipolar I disorder, whereas the term can now modify major depressive disorder and both bipolar I and bipolar II disorders. For practicing clinicians, MDD-MF can pose a nosological conundrum. Clinical investigators who enroll subjects in mood disorder trials often agonize over the precision with which DSM-5-TR symptoms are present in sufficient number and duration to constitute or meet criteria for a distinct diagnostic entity, such as a bipolar II disorder hypomanic episode. Fundamentally, the construct of MDD-MF pertains to instances in which 1) MDD is present but concomitant manic or hypomanic symptoms are too few in number or duration to \"qualify\" as a formal syndrome of mania or hypomania, and 2) there is no previous history of a full manic or hypomanic episode that would merit a lifetime diagnosis of bipolar I or II disorder. Herein lies a potential difference between the clinical approach adopted by most real-world practitioners and that adopted by investigators in clinical trials: the latter may be fastidious in determining whether diagnostic symptom and duration criteria for a specific entity are evident, whereas the former more often take a global, less finicky approach to gauging the presence of a  salient diagnostic entity, such as hypomania.  The spirit of the diagnosis reflects the observation that many unipolar depressed patients display subthreshold signs of hypomania. Concrete application of the DSM-5 construct of MDD-MF requires following the \"rules\" for counting symptoms. DSM-5 disallows the counting of four potential manic/hypomanic symptoms-namely, insomnia (as opposed to decreased need for sleep), distractibility, indecisiveness, and irritability-because they can also reflect MDD. DSM-5 identifies \"abnormally and persistently increased activity or energy\" as a mandatory criterion for diagnosing bipolar II hypomania, but this feature is not necessary to define MDD-MF. In the current case, if Ms. Bates had irritable mood in addition to her racing thoughts, rapid speech, and decreased need for sleep, she would meet DSM-5 criteria for bipolar II hypomania, and the mixed features specifier would then apply by virtue of her concomitant depressive symptoms.  The DSM-5-TR mixed features specifier requires that symptoms of the opposite polarity (in this case, mania/hypomania) be present \"the majority of days during the episode.\" This latter criterion means that if Ms. Bates's manic/hypomanic symptoms had been present for fewer than 4 days (the minimum duration criterion for diagnosing bipolar II hypomania), her subthreshold hypomania symptoms would not count toward either a \"mixed\" or a \"manic/hypomanic\" designation and her diagnosis would simply be MDD. Some authors criticized DSM-5's stringency of discounting subthreshold hypomania symptoms if they involved only two manic/hypomanic symptoms or if they failed to persist for the full duration of an episode, because such presentations (referred to in the literature as \"depressive mixed states\") have been observed when as few as two mania/ hypomania symptoms coexist with syndromal unipolar depression for as few as 2-4 days, and represent a construct that more closely resembles bipolar than unipolar disorder in family history, age at onset, and suicide risk.  One might speculate that Ms. Bates's psychomotor activation and subthreshold hypomania could have arisen as a consequence of the recent introduction of the novel serotonergic drug vilazodone. However, in this case, the history indicates that her subthreshold hypomanic symptoms predated her hospitalization and SSRI introduction; it would be important for the examiner to determine that this chronology is accurate  (which would suggest that her mixed symptoms are not iatrogenic), because the mixed features specifier requires that symptoms be \"not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance.\" Note that this qualifying statement is in contrast to the DSM-5 criteria for a manic/mixed/hypomanic episode, insofar as the emergence of mania/hypomania symptoms associated with recent antidepressant exposure is now classified as a bipolar disorder (similar to the viewpoint in DSM-III-R) and no longer as a substance-induced mood disorder (as in DSM-IV-TR). Follow-up studies of MDD patients with subthreshold hypomania indicate an approximately 25% chance of eventually developing a full mania or hypomania. Therefore, although not all MDD patients who display subthreshold mixed features will develop syndromal mania or hypomania, such patients warrant particularly careful evaluation, treatment, and longitudinal monitoring. Ms. Bates's symptoms of impulsivity and hyperactivity may have contributed to her acute presentation being wrongly identified as borderline personality disorder. Her longitudinal history does not support a pattern of symptoms suggestive of borderline personality disorder, and her suicide attempt and affective instability are readily accounted for by a current full affective syndrome. Since the emergence of MDD-MF as a new entity in DSM-5, few dedicated clinical trials have examined its effective treatment. Notably, one large randomized trial with lurasidone for MDD-MF found improvement in both depressive and subthreshold manic symptoms. Additionally, in bipolar disorder, antidepressant use in the setting of even subthreshold mania symptoms has been shown to destabilize mood, prompting some experts, by extrapolation, to advise avoiding monoaminergic antidepressants in MDD- MF. Further studies are needed to help identify optimally safe and effective pharmacotherapies for MDD with mixed features in patients who do not meet diagnostic criteria for a lifetime categorical diagnosis of bipolar disorder.",

         "Peter D. Kramer, M.D.  Ian Campbell was a 32-year-old architect who presented for psychiatric consultation because he was floundering at work. His boss had expressed concern after he failed to make progress on a simple project. When Mr. Campbell explained that he had been distracted by problems at home, his boss suggested that more seemed wrong. Mr. Campbell called his internist, who sent him to a neurologist, who referred him for psychiatric evaluation. Mr. Campbell had encountered this problem, difficulty concentrating, before. In college, after his father died of a chronic illness, Mr. Campbell had been unable to study and had taken time off. Twice at his prior job, he experienced episodes lasting months in which he had difficulty making decisions. One of these intervals followed a romantic setback. The patient's mother and sister had been diagnosed with major depressive disorder and treated successfully with medication. A maternal uncle had committed suicide.  The current impairment's onset accompanied the breakdown of Mr. Campbell's marriage of 6 years. Two months earlier, his wife had filed for divorce, announcing that she would live in the distant city her work had taken her to. Mr. Campbell had expected to feel relief; he said his wife had been hostile throughout the marriage. He had begun to entertain fond thoughts of a coworker. Nevertheless, he felt \"flat\"-unable to imagine a future. Closer questioning revealed that Mr. Campbell's problems went beyond impaired cognition. He described apathy and diminished energy. Jazz was a passion, but he no longer attended recitals-although impaired concentration probably played a role as well. Listening, the psychiatrist noted probable retardation of speech. Mr. Campbell said that his employer had mentioned that he was \"moving in slow motion.\" The problems were worse in the mornings. In the evenings, Mr. Campbell noticed a spark of energy. He put on music and reviewed reports that he had ignored during the workday. Mr. Campbell declined to characterize himself as sad. He was pleased that the marriage was ending. But the psychiatrist was struck by her own affect in Mr. Campbell's presence; she felt glum, pessimistic, even weepy. She questioned Mr. Campbell at length about depressed mood, changed sleep and appetite, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, and thoughts of death. None of these attributions, he said, applied. Nor had he had indicators of disorders that can be confused with depression. Between episodes of impairment, he felt and functioned well. The psychiatrist decided that the problem at hand was close enough to depression to warrant treatment. Factors that influenced her decision included the partial syndromal presentation, diurnal variation, periodic recurrence, lack of future orientation, and her own empathic experience. She proposed psychotherapy centered on Mr. Campbell's decompensation in the face of loss. He insisted that he did not see the impending divorce in that light. The two agreed on brief psychotherapy supplemented by antidepressants. Within weeks, Mr. Campbell was functioning at full capacity. During the treatment, the psychiatrist was unable to elicit evidence of depressive symptoms beyond those noted in the initial history. All the same, she was convinced that the impaired concentration was a sign and symptom of something very much like major depressive disorder.",
         "Discussion\t The operational definition of major depressive disorder (MDD), which reached official standing in the third edition of DSM, is one of the great inventions in modern medicine. The approach has catalyzed productive research in fields ranging from cell biology to social psychiatry. Most of what is known about mood disorder, from the abnormalities it represents in the brain to the harm it does in lives, arises from the delineation of depression out of the inchoate domain of neurosis and psychosis. That said, the definition is arbitrary. Historians have traced the DSM criteria to a 1957 Journal of the American Medical Association article whose lead author, a Boston psychiatrist, Walter Cassidy, had tried to systematize the study of a condition similar to today's MDD. For diagnosis, Cassidy required that patients have six of 10 symptoms from a list that included slow thinking, poor appetite, loss of concentration, and others that remain current. Later asked how he chose six, Cassidy said, \"It sounded about right.\" Operational approaches to depression, from DSM to the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, are attempts to create reliability in the face of an inherently ill-defined phenomenon-that is, clinicians' working diagnoses. Psychiatrists identified depressed patients using prevailing methods-sometimes with attention to their own empathic resonance with the patient; the symptom- and severity-based definitions translated the impressionistic into reproducible form. Depression, however, has no known natural boundary. Behavioral geneticists find the DSM criteria arbitrary. Number, severity, and duration of symptoms each represent a continuum of disability. Patients who suffer four severe symptoms of depression for 2 weeks tend to do badly down the road. Five moderately disabling symptoms for 10 days confer a poor prognosis. Five mild symptoms, if they persist, predict substantial risk. In this case, Mr. Campbell appears not to have had the five of nine criteria necessary for a diagnosis of MDD, but he would likely qualify for a DSM-5 diagnosis of other specified depressive disorder (depressive episode with insufficient symptoms). It is important to recognize that depression's harm-suffering, future full episodes, work and social problems, suicide-is only slightly less in people who narrowly miss full criteria. In one  analysis, later MDD was as common in those who reported three or four symptoms as in those who reported five. Estimates of heritability are similar, too; \"minor\" depression in one sibling predicts full depression in an identical twin. One form of other specified depressive disorder appears especially dangerous: recurrent brief depression is associated with high rates of attempted suicide. These other specified forms of depression are probably less prevalent than MDD. Studies that find lifetime rates for MDD on the order of well over 25% find the lifetime risk for these less severe syndromes to be on the order of 8%-9%. Patients with fewer symptoms tend also to have fewer accompanying mental illnesses. They are, for instance, less likely than patients with MDD to become dependent on drugs of abuse or on alcohol. The DSM-5 categories unspecified depressive disorder and other specified depressive disorder acknowledge an important clinical reality: effectively, the near penumbra of depression is depression. Low-level episodes can appear as precursors of MDD and as sequelae, even in the absence of persistent depressive disorder; on its own, low-level depression represents suffering and confers risk. Mr. Campbell's doctor will want to take his complaints seriously. Mr. Campbell may have entered a \"depressive episode with insufficient symptoms,\" but the insufficiency relates to the symptom count for a major depressive episode, not to the level of illness needed to trigger clinical concern. Especially when peripheral factors-such as, in this case, the diurnal variation typical of classic depression-suggest mood disorder, the clinician will suspect that effectively the condition is depression and will approach the situation with the corresponding urgency and thoroughness.",

         "Russell F. Lim, M.D.  Ka Fang, a 59-year-old widowed Hmong woman, was referred to a mental health care clinic after she recurrently complained to her primary care physician of fatigue, chronic back pain, and insomnia. Over the preceding 11 months, the internist had prescribed clonazepam for sleep and Vicodin (hydrocodone/acetaminophen) for pain. Her sleep had improved and her pain decreased, but she continued to feel tired all day. At that point, the internist referred her for the psychiatric evaluation. Ms. Fang had immigrated to the United States from Thailand a decade earlier. Natives of Laos, she and her family had spent almost two decades in a Thai refugee camp following the Vietnam War. Her family had resettled in the Sacramento area with the assistance of a local church group. When questioned through a Hmong interpreter, Ms. Fang denied depressed mood. When asked if she enjoyed things, she said that she felt privileged to be in America and had no right to complain. She said she felt she was not doing enough to help her family. She was embarrassed by her fatigue because she did not \"do anything all day.\" She denied any intention to harm herself. She said she was very proud of all her children, especially her son, who had been an  excellent student in Thailand and spoke good English. Nevertheless, her son, his wife, and their two young children followed many of the cultural practices that they had followed in Laos and Thailand, and often prepared Hmong food for dinner. He and his wife had bought a small farm outside Sacramento and were doing well, cultivating Asian vegetables. Her son had employed her two daughters on the farm until both had moved back to live in the Hmong community in Sacramento. Ms. Fang indicated that the transition to California had gone better than she had expected. The biggest disappointments for her had been her husband's unexpected death from a heart attack 1 year earlier and the fact that most of her extended family had remained in Thailand. On mental status examination, the patient was short and heavyset. She wore a floral short-sleeve blouse, black polyester slacks, black flip-flops, and no makeup. She had white strings tied around her wrists. Her eyes were generally downcast, but she seemed alert. She appeared sad and constricted but denied feeling depressed. Her speech was slow and careful. She denied all hallucinations, suicidality, and homicidality. Cognitive testing revealed normal attention and concentration. She had little formal education and appeared to be functionally illiterate. Her insight into her illness appeared limited. When asked about the strings around her wrists, Ms. Fang explained that she had recently sought out a Hmong shaman, who had organized several soul-calling ceremonies to reunite with distant relatives.",
         "Discussion Ms. Fang presents for an evaluation of psychiatric contributions to her fatigue, insomnia, and pain. She endorses symptoms of insomnia, feelings of worthlessness, and fatigue, but she denies a depressed mood, anhedonia, agitation, weight loss, poor concentration, or thoughts of suicide. She fulfills only three of nine DSM-5-TR major depressive disorder criteria; five are needed to make the diagnosis. Ms. Fang reports a number of pertinent cultural issues. She lives in a Hmong-speaking household with her son and his family on their farm outside of Sacramento. They raise vegetables, their apparent occupation when they lived in Laos and Thailand. In Hmong  culture, the young married couple generally lives with the family of the husband, making the mother-in-law especially prominent. Although Ms. Fang expresses her appreciation for her situation, she may still feel marginalized and lonely, especially in the context of her husband's death 1 year earlier and her daughters having moved back to the Hmong community in Sacramento. Being functionally illiterate-not uncommon in societies in which the limited educational resources are primarily channeled to boys-Ms. Fang is not able to avail herself of tools to maintain connections, such as e-mail and newspapers. Her feelings of isolation are likely connected to the strings that the interviewer noticed on her wrists. Shamanistic soul-calling ceremonies are intended to reunite families, and she may be especially in need given her distance from her daughters, her Southeast Asian home, her Hmong culture, her extended family, and her ancestors.  In assessing whether Ms. Fang has a mood disorder, it is useful to know that there is no word in the Hmong language for depression. Like many people from other cultures, Ms. Fang describes somatic symptoms such as insomnia, anergia, and bodily aches to express depressed feelings. These probably are not adequate to meet symptomatic criteria for a DSM-5 major depressive disorder, and, by report, her symptoms have not yet persisted for the 2 years required for persistent depressive disorder. It would be useful to get collateral information from one of her children, who might be able to provide information that could solidify the diagnosis. As it stands, she best fits the diagnosis of other specified depressive disorder (depressive episode with insufficient symptoms).",

Barnhill, M.D.  The DSM-5 chapter on anxiety disorders brings together a cluster of presentations in which anxiety, fear, and avoidance are prominent. Among the most prevalent psychiatric diagnoses, anxiety disorders can also be among the most difficult to definitively diagnose. One complicating factor is that anxiety, fear, and avoidance are normal and adaptive responses, leading to some inevitable ambiguity in evaluations of people with mild symptoms. Another complicating factor is that anxiety-related emotions can be experienced as physical symptoms. Fear-a normal response to a real or perceived imminent threat-is almost always associated with autonomic hyperarousal; such hyperarousal can be difficult for patients to identify or describe, especially if it is chronic. Similarly, anxiety- the emotional experience of fear unaccompanied by a clear threat-may be experienced as muscle tension and vigilance, which can blend imperceptibly into background noise  for someone with chronically elevated anxiety levels.  A third complication is that anxiety disorders are often comorbid with one another and with mood, substance, and personality disorders, which can make it difficult to adequately attend to the manifestations of each diagnosis. Finally, definitions of anxiety disorders are descriptive of phenomena with unknown pathophysiologies, and despite many advances, the field of psychiatry is not yet close to definitively identifying nosological categories based on underlying etiology. DSM-5-TR maintains several changes that were initially made in DSM-5. For example, panic continues to be described in two different ways. Panic attacks are often comorbid, and they can now be identified as a specifier for all DSM-5-TR anxiety disorders, as well as for some other psychiatric disorders. When persistent panic attacks induce an ongoing, significant fear of further panic attacks, the more likely diagnosis is panic disorder. Historically linked to panic disorder, agoraphobia continues to be identified as a distinct diagnosis that can develop in the context of a variety of stressors and psychiatric syndromes. As with specific phobia and social anxiety disorder, agoraphobia no longer requires that individuals over age 18 perceive the anxiety as unreasonable. Instead, the clinician can make a judgment as to whether the anxiety is out of proportion to the actual danger or threat. To reduce the likelihood of overdiagnosing transient fears, these disorders must persist for at least 6 months for all individuals rather than just for those under age 18.  All of the DSM-5 structural changes were maintained in DSM-5-TR. For example, separation anxiety disorder was moved into the chapter on anxiety disorders from the chapter on neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnosis still requires an onset before age 18, but the chapter move is intended to encourage clinicians to recognize the 6% of adults who meet criteria for this childhood-onset disorder. DSM-5 also created two new chapters for conditions that had largely been conceptualized as anxiety disorders: disorders related to OCD (i.e., OCD as well as conditions such as body dysmorphic disorder) and disorders related to trauma and  stress (i.e., PTSD as well as adjustment disorders). These new chapters include clusters of disorders in which anxiety may play a prominent role but which also have other features (e.g., obsessions/compulsions or a significant trauma history). DSM-5-TR describes temperamental traits often implicated in the development of anxiety symptoms. These include negative affectivity (or neuroticism), which refers to the disposition to experience negative emotions, and anxiety sensitivity, which refers to the disposition to believe that symptoms of anxiety are harmful. Also relevant to the anxiety disorders are such traits as behavioral inhibition, harm avoidance, and an attentional bias to threat. Cultural awareness is emphasized throughout DSM-5-TR. In addition to describing recent evidence regarding rates of anxiety disorders within subgroups based on gender, ethnicity, home country, and so on, DSM-5-TR encourages clinicians to maintain a broad sensitivity to culture, including a recognition that not all patients believe in a Western medical model of disease. Clinician curiosity into alternative explanatory models can improve the therapeutic alliance and patient adherence. For example, within Cambodian culture, khy๏ฟฝl (wind) attacks involve dizziness, tinnitus, and neck soreness. Catastrophic cognitions and panic attacks can be triggered by the perceived dangerousness of a symptom, such as neck soreness, that may be understood to reflect disorder of khy๏ฟฝl. The clinician would not be expected to know all culturally mediated disorders from all regions of the world, but a successful medical interaction might depend on listening for clues that the patient (or a respected parent or grandparent) has theories about medicine and health that do not conform to a Western medical model. Tactful interviewing can often lead to a more precise diagnosis and a more culturally sensitive treatment plan. Although anxiety is pervasive, and anxiety disorders are perhaps the most common psychiatric disorder, DSM-5 emphasizes that underdiagnosis of anxiety disorders can have serious consequences. Frequently misdiagnosed and undertreated, anxiety disorders are commonly associated with decreased work performance and life satisfaction and with increases in suicidality, disability days, medical and psychiatric comorbidities, and medical resource use.  The various anxiety-related disorders can often be clearly differentiated but are frequently comorbid with each other and with other psychiatric diagnoses, including major depressive disorder, personality disorders, and substance use disorders. A chief complaint of \"anxiety\" does not make the diagnosis but is instead the beginning of a clinical thought process that can range throughout DSM-5.

         "Loes Jongerden, M.A. Susan B๏ฟฝgels, Ph.D. Logan was a 12-year-old boy who was referred to mental health care for long-standing anxiety about losing his parents and relatively recent fears about getting a severe disease. Although his parents described a long history of anxiety, Logan's acute problem began 5 weeks prior to the consultation, when he watched a television show about rare and fatal diseases. Afterward, he became scared that he might have a hidden disease. His parents reported three \"panic attacks\" in the prior month, marked by anxiety, dizziness, sweats, and shortness of breath. About that same time, Logan began to complain of frequent headaches and stomachaches. Logan's own theory was that his bodily aches were caused  by his fears about being ill and about his parents going away, but the pain was still uncomfortable. He insisted he was not scared about having more panic attacks but was petrified about being left sick and alone. These illness fears developed several times a week, usually when Logan was in bed, when he \"felt something\" in his body, or when he heard about diseases. Logan had begun to suffer from anxieties as a young child. Kindergarten was notable for intense separation difficulties. He was briefly bullied in third grade, which led to his first panic attacks and worsening anxiety. According to his parents, \"there always seemed to be a new anxiety.\" These included fear of the toilet, the dark, sleeping alone, being alone, and being pestered. Logan's most persistent fear revolved around his parents' safety. He was generally fine when both were at work or at home, but when they were in transit, or anywhere else, he was generally afraid that they would die in an accident. When the parents were late from work or when they tried to go out together or on an errand without him, Logan became frantic, calling and texting incessantly. Logan was predominantly concerned about his mother's safety, and she had gradually reduced her solo activities to a minimum. As she said, it felt like \"he would like to follow me into the toilet.\" Logan was less demanding toward his father, who believed his wife had been too soft and overprotective. Logan and his family underwent several months of psychotherapy when Logan was age 10. The father said therapy helped his wife become less overprotective, and Logan's anxiety seemed to improve. Logan's mother agreed with this assessment, although she said she was not sure what she was supposed to do when her son was panicking whenever she tried to leave the house or whenever he worried about getting a disease. Logan's developmental history was otherwise unremarkable. His grades were generally good. His teachers agreed that he was quiet but had several friends and collaborated well with other children. He was quick, however, to negatively interpret the intentions of other children. For example, he tended to be very sensitive to any indication that he was being picked on. Logan's family history was pertinent for panic disorder, agoraphobia, and social anxiety disorder in the mother. The maternal grandmother was described as \"at least as\" anxious  as Logan's mother. The father denied psychiatric illness in his family.  On examination, Logan was a friendly, articulate boy who was cooperative and goal directed. He was generally in a \"good mood\" but cried when talking about his fears of dying and getting sick. He denied suicidality and hopelessness but indicated he was desperate to get over his problems before starting high school. His cognition was good. His insight and judgment appeared intact except as related to his anxiety issues.",
         "Discussion Logan has had separation fears since he was a young child. To qualify for separation anxiety disorder, DSM-5 requires three of eight symptoms. Logan has at least five, including long-standing, excessive, and disturbing fears of anticipated separations; of harm to his parents; of events that could lead to separations; and of being left alone. He also had physical complaints that could be traced to fears of dying and separation. Logan also has panic attacks. He does not meet criteria for a panic disorder, however, because he is not afraid of having an attack. Instead, his panic seems related to fears of separation or getting a disease. Panic attacks would, therefore, be listed as a specifier of separation anxiety disorder. Although Logan is anxious about having an illness, his symptoms do not appear to meet criteria for illness anxiety disorder: the duration of his fear of diseases is not 6 months, he does not visit doctors, and he seeks reassurance not about his health but about being left alone by his attachment figures. His symptoms do not meet criteria for generalized anxiety disorder because his predominant concern is specifically about separation from his parents. He may have met criteria for social anxiety disorder in the past (fear of being pestered), but social fears do not appear to dominate the current clinical picture. Anxiety disorders have been present in the mother and grandmother, which may indicate a genetic predisposition. Multigenerational anxiety may also be transmitted via learning, modeling, and overprotective parenting. In Logan's case, the mother is noted to have panic disorder, agoraphobia, and social anxiety disorder, and both parents agree that her own anxieties have influenced her parenting style. In particular, Logan's fears appear to be rewarded: the parents stay home, rarely leave Logan alone, and respond  quickly to all his calls and text messages. They appear to have frequent conversations about his fears but may not spend enough time discussing compensatory strategies. The father does seem to try to encourage Logan's autonomy, but the parents appear to not agree on the correct overall strategy. Unsupportive coparenting may have contributed to the maintenance of Logan's problems. One potentially important change in DSM-5 was the relocation of separation anxiety disorder into the anxiety disorders chapter. In DSM-III and DSM-IV, it was discussed in the chapter aimed at disorders that begin in infancy, childhood, and adolescence. Separation anxiety disorder can extend into adulthood, however, and Logan's mother may herself have had adult separation anxiety disorder (as well as other anxiety disorders). Her own fears of separation may well be affecting how she is raising her son and be contributing to his ongoing anxiety.",

         "Carlo Faravelli, M.D.  Maria Greco was a 23-year-old single woman who was referred for psychiatric evaluation by her cardiologist. In the prior 2 months, she had presented to the emergency room four times for acute complaints of palpitations, shortness of breath, sweats, trembling, and the fear that she was about to die. Each of these events had a rapid onset. The symptoms peaked within minutes, leaving her scared, exhausted, and fully convinced that she had just experienced a heart attack. Medical evaluations done right after these episodes yielded normal physical exam findings, vital signs, lab results, toxicology screens, and electrocardiograms.  The patient reported a total of five such attacks in the prior 3 months, with the panic occurring at work, at home, and while driving a car. She had developed a persistent fear of having other attacks, which led her to take many days off work and to avoid exercise, driving, and coffee. Her sleep quality declined, as did her mood. She avoided social relationships. She did not accept the reassurance offered to her by friends and physicians, believing that the medical workups were negative because they were performed after the resolution of the symptoms. She continued to suspect that something was wrong with her heart and that without an accurate diagnosis, she was going to die. When she had a panic attack while asleep in the middle of the night, she finally agreed to see a psychiatrist.  Ms. Greco denied a history of previous psychiatric disorders except for a history of anxiety during childhood that had been diagnosed as a \"school phobia.\" The patient's mother had committed suicide by overdose 4 years earlier in the context of recurrent major depressive disorder. At the time of the evaluation, the patient was living with her father and two younger siblings. The patient had graduated from high school, was working as a telephone operator, and was not dating anyone. Her family and social histories were otherwise noncontributory. On examination, the patient was an anxious-appearing, cooperative, coherent young woman. She denied depression but did appear worried and was preoccupied with ideas of having heart disease. She denied psychotic symptoms, confusion, and all suicidality. Her cognition was intact, insight was limited, and judgment was fair.",
         "Discussion  Ms. Greco has panic attacks, which are abrupt surges of fear and/or discomfort that peak within minutes and are accompanied by physical and/or cognitive symptoms. In DSM-5, panic attacks are seen as a particular kind of fear response and are not found only in anxiety disorders. Therefore, panic is conceptualized in two ways within DSM-5. The first is as a \"panic attack\" specifier that can accompany any DSM-5 diagnosis. The second is as a panic disorder when the individual meets the more restrictive criteria for the disorder. Ms. Greco appears to satisfy the multiple criteria required for panic disorder. First, her panic attacks are recurrent, and she more than meets the requirement for four of 13 panic symptoms: palpitations, sweating, trembling, smothering, chest pain, and a persistent fear of dying. The diagnosis also requires that the panic attacks affect the person between episodes. Not only does she constantly worry about having a heart attack (despite medical workups and frequent reassurance), she avoids situations and activities that might trigger another panic attack. These symptoms should also last at least 1 month, and Ms. Greco has been symptomatic for 2 months. The diagnosis of panic disorder also requires an evaluation for the many other causes of panic. These include medications, medical illness, substances of abuse, and other mental disorders. According to the history, this 23-year-old woman takes no medications, has no medical illness, and denies use of substances of abuse. Her physical examinations, electrocardiograms, routine lab results, and toxicology screens are either normal or negative. It might be useful to ask Ms. Greco specifically about herbal and complementary medications, but it appears that her symptoms are psychiatric in origin. Many psychiatric disorders are associated with panic, and Ms. Greco may have been primed for panic attacks by another condition. She reports a childhood history of anxiety and \"social phobia\" (DSM-5-TR social anxiety disorder), although those symptoms appear to have remitted. Her mother killed herself 4 years earlier in the context of recurrent major depressive disorder. Details are unknown. Such a traumatic event would undoubtedly have had an effect on Ms. Greco. In fact, there would likely be two different traumas: the abrupt effects of the suicide and the more long-standing effects of having a chronically or recurrently depressed mother. Further exploration might focus on the psychosocial events leading up to these panic attacks.  For example, Ms. Greco's \"school phobia\" may have been a manifestation of undiagnosed separation anxiety disorder, and her recent panic may have developed in the setting of dating, sexual exploration, and/or a move away from her father and younger siblings. She does not present a pattern of panic in response to social anxiety or a specific phobia, but she also denies that her symptoms are psychiatric, so she may not recognize the link between her panic symptoms and another set of symptoms. It might be useful to assess Ms. Greco for anxiety sensitivity, which is the tendency to view anxiety as harmful, and for \"negative affectivity,\" which is the proneness to experience negative emotions. Both of these personality traits may be associated with the development of panic.  Because certain symptom clusters are often not recognized spontaneously by patients as either symptoms or clusters of symptoms, it would be useful to look more specifically for disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. In addition, it might be helpful to explore the sequence of symptoms. For example, the patient's panic seems to have led to her worries about heart disease. If the illness worries preceded the panic, she might also have an illness anxiety disorder or somatic symptom disorder. Frequently comorbid with panic are depressive and bipolar disorders. Ms. Greco does have depressive symptoms, including insomnia and a preoccupation with death, but otherwise her symptoms do not appear to meet the criteria for a depression diagnosis. Her symptoms would, however, need to be observed longitudinally. Not only does her mother's history of depression increase her risk for depression, but Ms. Greco may not be especially insightful into her own emotional states. It would also be useful to specifically look for symptoms of bipolar disorder. Mania and hypomania are often forgotten by patients or are not perceived as problematic, and a missed diagnosis could lead to inappropriate treatment and an exacerbation of bipolar symptoms. If possible, a tactful review of her mother's symptoms may be useful, because both suicidality and suicide are more common in bipolar disorders than in depressive disorders. Furthermore, the development of panic appears to increase the risk of suicidal thoughts.  Although more should be explored, Ms. Greco does appear to have a panic disorder. DSM-5 suggests the assessment of whether the panic is expected or unexpected. It  appears that Ms. Greco's initial panic attacks occurred in situations that might have been seen as stressful, such as while driving and at work, and so may or may not have been expected. Her last episode happened while she was asleep, however, so her panic attacks would be classified as unexpected. DSM-5 delinked agoraphobia from panic disorder. They can be comorbid, but agoraphobia is now recognized as developing in situations besides panic. In Ms. Greco's case, her active avoidance of driving, exercise, and caffeine is better conceptualized as a behavioral complication of panic disorder rather than a symptom of agoraphobia. Accurate diagnosis and treatment are important to prevent her symptoms from becoming more severe and chronic.",

         "Barbara L. Milrod, M.D.  Nadine was a 15-year-old girl whose mother brought her for a psychiatric evaluation to help with her long-standing shyness.  Although Nadine was initially reluctant to say much about herself, she said she felt constantly tense. She added that the anxiety had been \"really bad\" for several years and was often accompanied by episodes of dizziness and crying. She was generally unable to speak in any situation outside of her home or school classes. She refused to leave her house alone for fear of being forced to interact with someone. She was especially anxious around other teenagers, but she had also become \"too nervous\" to speak to adult neighbors she had known for years. She said it felt impossible to walk into a restaurant and order from \"a stranger at the counter\" for fear of being humiliated. She also felt constantly on her guard, needing to avoid the possibility of getting attacked, a strategy that really only worked when she was alone in her home.  Nadine tried to conceal her crippling anxiety from her parents, typically telling them that she \"just didn't feel like\" going out. Feeling trapped and incompetent, Nadine said she contemplated suicide \"all the time.\" In the month before her mother finally brought her in for a psychiatric evaluation, Nadine had begun to cut herself on her thighs to \"feel pain and relieve stress.\" No one in the family was aware of this development. Nadine had always been \"shy\" and had been teased at recess since she started kindergarten. The teasing had escalated to outright bullying by the time she was in seventh grade. The bullying took on a cultural/racially motivated undertone; Nadine and her family were of a different ethnicity than the vast majority of her schoolmates. For 2 years, day after difficult day, Nadine's peers turned on her \"like a snarling wolf pack,\" calling her \"stupid,\" \"ugly,\" and \"crazy.\" Not infrequently, one of them would stare at her and tell her she would be better off committing suicide. One girl (the ringleader, as well as a former elementary school chum) hit Nadine on one occasion, giving her a black eye. Nadine did not fight back. This event was witnessed by an adult neighbor, who told Nadine's mother. When Nadine's mother asked her about the incident, Nadine denied it, saying she had \"fallen\" on the street. She did, however, mention to her mother \"in passing\" that she wanted to switch schools, but her delivery was so offhand that at the time, her mother casually advised against the switch. Nadine suffered on, sobbing herself to sleep most nights and wishing that she would not wake up.  Full of hope and ideas of escape from the bullies and their narrowness, Nadine transferred to a specialty arts high school for ninth grade. Although the bullying ceased,  her anxiety symptoms paradoxically worsened. She felt even more unable to venture into public spaces and felt increasingly embarrassed by her inability to develop the sort of independence typical of a 15-year-old. She said she had begun to spend whole weekends \"trapped\" in her home and had become scared to even read by herself in the local park. Nadine's social anxiety had evolved into true agoraphobia. She had nightly nightmares about the bullies in her old school. Her preoccupation with suicide grew. Her parents had thought she would outgrow being shy and sought psychiatric help for her only after a teacher remarked that her anxiety and social isolation were keeping her from making the sort of grades and doing the sort of extracurricular activities that were necessary to get into a good college. Nadine described her mother as loud, excitable, aggressive, and \"a little frightening.\" Her father was a successful tax attorney who worked long hours. Nadine described him as shy in social situations (\"He's more like me\"). Nadine said she and her father sometimes joked that the goal of any evening was to avoid tipping the mother into a rage. Nadine added that she \"never wanted to be anything like her mother.\"",
         "Discussion Nadine appears to have an underlying shy temperament. Unfortunately, with sandbox logic, shy children are often picked on. If they never learn adequate ways to defend themselves, bullying can escalate, particularly during their middle and high school years. This pattern can lead these anxiety-prone and already high-risk adolescents to be traumatized by their peers. In Nadine's case, the added element of cross-cultural discrimination and intimidation heightened her sense of helplessness and shame. The intensity of her anxiety symptoms, her increasing social isolation, and her sense of having no one to whom she could turn combined to increase her risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors.  By the time Nadine saw a psychiatrist, her distress had persisted for years and she appears to have developed a cluster of three DSM-5 diagnoses that are frequently comorbid. First, she has marked and excessive anxiety about multiple social situations, including those with her peers. These situations always invoke fears of embarrassment and a sense of her incompetence, again partially fueled by the culturally loaded bullying.  Nadine tries to avoid these situations as best she can. She therefore meets the symptomatic criteria for DSM-5-TR social anxiety disorder, which is her primary diagnosis. As is common among children and adolescents, Nadine's fears took on a life of their own after the bullying experience. She initially avoided anxiety-provoking social situations, which is an aspect of her social anxiety disorder. That anxiety gradually expanded and exploded, however, and she began to have panic attacks if she even tried to leave her house by herself. When she became persistently unable to even go alone to a nearby park, she would be said to have a second DSM-5 diagnosis, agoraphobia. Such expansion is so common among children and adolescents that contemporary treatment studies tend to focus interventions on a range of DSM-defined anxiety disorders rather than on a single disorder.  Nadine should also be considered for a third diagnosis: DSM-5-TR posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). She has experienced intense and prolonged bullying, which constitutes trauma according to DSM-5-TR Criterion A, especially when a child is socially isolated and going through a vulnerable period of development. To meet DSM-5-TR criteria for PTSD, Nadine would need to manifest clinically significant symptoms for at least 1 month in four different areas: intrusion (the nightmares, which she reported nightly), avoidance (of peers), negative alterations of cognitions and mood (exaggerated and negative views about herself, panic attacks when she fears reexposure to her trauma, i.e., bullying by her neighborhood peers), and alterations in arousal and reactivity (being always on her guard). Because some of these symptoms can also refer to Nadine's social anxiety disorder, clinical judgment is required to avoid overdiagnosing PTSD. Nevertheless, it does appear that these two conditions are comorbid in Nadine. It is also important to explore the possibility that these anxiety symptoms might be attributable to a nonpsychiatric medical condition or to the use of medications or substances, but none of these appear to be involved in Nadine's case.  When evaluating adolescent trauma, it is useful to recall that although other children are generally the bullies, teachers and administrators can contribute to the problem by paying inadequate attention to schoolyard dynamics or by tacitly tolerating them. This appears to be true in Nadine's case. As she reported, \"There is no way that my teachers  did not know what was happening to me.\" In addition, Nadine's parents seem to have been able to ignore her desperate situation until they became concerned about her college admissions. It is also useful to recognize that Nadine's mother is a loud, explosive woman whom Nadine has avoided \"upsetting\" since very early childhood. This tenuous mother-child relationship (or dysregulated attachment relationship) likely played a formative role in Nadine's shyness. Fear of her mother's explosions might have contributed to Nadine's persistent sense that she was not safe, for example, and might have prevented her from developing the tools that she needed to be successfully assertive. As the psychiatric evaluation evolves, it might be reasonable to discuss with Nadine the possibility that her failure to defend herself against the bullying might be related to her intense desire not to be anything like her loud and frightening mother.",

         "Katharina Meyerbr๏ฟฝker, Ph.D.  Olaf Hendricks, a 51-year-old married businessman, presented to an outpatient psychiatrist with problems relating to periodically feeling helpless and lacking confidence. He reported that he usually feels fine except when he is confronted with his inability to travel by airplane. His only daughter had delivered a baby in the prior year, and although he desperately wanted to meet his first granddaughter, he felt unable to fly across the Atlantic Ocean to where his daughter lived. The patient's anxiety about flying had begun 3 years earlier when he was on an airplane that landed during an ice storm. He had last flown a year earlier but had cried during both takeoff and landing; he had then found himself unable to return from that trip by airplane and instead took a train from Rome to Amsterdam. He had gone with his wife to an airport one additional time, 1 year prior to the evaluation, to fly to his daughter's wedding in the United States. Despite having drunk a significant amount of alcohol, Mr. Hendricks felt unable to board the airplane. After that failed effort, he tended to feel intense anxiety when he even considered the possibility of flying. Anxiety about business trips had led him to decline a promotion as well as an external job offer. Mr. Hendricks sees himself as a \"family man\" and feels terrible that he failed to attend his daughter's wedding and has not yet been able to meet his granddaughter.  Aside from guilt and regret related to his inability to fly, Mr. Hendricks denied other symptoms of depression and anxiety. He had increased his alcohol consumption to three glasses of wine nightly in order to \"unwind,\" but denied any history of alcohol complications or withdrawal symptoms. He also denied a family history of psychiatric problems. He denied experiencing anxiety in other situations, indicating that his colleagues saw him as a forceful and successful businessman who could \"easily\" deliver speeches in front of hundreds of people. When specifically asked, he reported that as a child, he had been \"petrified\" that he might get attacked by a wild animal. This fear had led him to refuse to go on family camping trips or even on long hikes in the country. As an adult, he said that he had no worries about being attacked by wild animals because he lived in a  large city and took vacations by train to other large urban areas.",
         "Discussion Mr. Hendricks has such intense anxiety about flying that he will not get on airplanes despite being intensely motivated to do so. Even the thought of airplanes and airports causes significant distress. This fear is persistent and has caused significant functional impairment. He meets diagnostic criteria, therefore, for specific phobia. DSM-5 also includes specifiers to describe the phobia. In Mr. Hendricks's case, the phobic stimulus is flying, which would be coded as a \"situational\" specifier. (Other common situational stimuli include elevators and enclosed spaces.) Most people with specific phobia fear more than one object or situation. Although Mr. Hendricks initially denies other anxieties, he does describe having had a highly distressing fear of being attacked by wild animals when he was younger. This fear led him to skip camping trips and hikes. He now lives in an urban environment where he is highly unlikely to come across a wild animal, but DSM-5 allows for a diagnosis of a specific phobia even when the phobic stimulus is not likely to be encountered. From a clinical perspective, uncovering such phobias is important because avoidance can not only cause fairly obvious distress and dysfunction (an inability to fly leading to an inability to visit family or optimally perform at work) but can also lead to life decisions that may not be completely conscious (a fear of wild animals leading to systematic avoidance of non-urban areas).  In addition to animals and situations, there are a number of other categories of phobic stimuli. These include the natural environment (e.g., heights, storms), blood-injection- injury (e.g., needles, invasive medical procedures), and other stimuli (e.g., loud sounds or costumed characters). Specific phobia is most often comorbid with other anxiety disorders as well as depressive, substance use, somatic symptom, and personality disorders. Mr. Hendricks denies that his alcohol use is causing distress or dysfunction, so it does not appear to meet criteria for a DSM-5 disorder, but further exploration might indicate that his nightly drinking is causing problems with some aspects of his life. Similarly, further exploration of his depressive moods might identify a mood disorder that may be a focus  for clinical attention. If it turns out that the flying phobia is a symptom of another disorder (e.g., a manifestation of agoraphobia), then the other disorder (the agoraphobia) would be the more accurate diagnosis. As it stands now, however, Mr. Hendricks appears to have fairly classic specific phobia.",

         "Ryan E. Lawrence, M.D. Deborah L. Cabaniss, M.D. Peggy Isaac was a 41-year-old administrative assistant who was referred for an outpatient evaluation by her primary care physician with a chief complaint of \"I'm always on edge.\" She lived alone and had never married or had children. She had never before seen a psychiatrist.  Ms. Isaac had lived with her longtime boyfriend until 8 months earlier, at which time he had abruptly ended the relationship to date a younger woman. Soon thereafter, Ms. Isaac began to agonize about routine tasks and the possibility of making mistakes at work. She felt uncharacteristically tense and fatigued. She had difficulty focusing. She also started to worry excessively about money and, to economize, she moved into a cheaper apartment in a less desirable neighborhood. She repeatedly sought reassurance from her office mates and her mother. No one seemed able to help, and she worried about being \"too much of a burden.\"  During the 3 months prior to the evaluation, Ms. Isaac began to avoid going out at night, fearing that something bad would happen and she would be unable to summon help. More recently, she avoided going out in the daytime as well. She also felt \"exposed and vulnerable\" walking to the grocery store three blocks away, so she avoided shopping. After describing that she had figured out how to get her food delivered, she added, \"It's ridiculous. I honestly feel something terrible is going to happen in one of the aisles and no one will help me, so I won't even go in.\" When in her apartment, she could often relax and enjoy a good book or movie. Ms. Isaac said she had \"always been a little nervous.\" Through much of kindergarten, she had cried inconsolably when her mother tried to drop her off. She reported seeing a counselor at age 10, during her parents' divorce, because \"my mother thought I was too clingy.\" She added that she had never liked being alone, having had boyfriends constantly (occasionally overlapping) since age 16. She explained, \"I hated being single, and I was always pretty, so I was never single for very long.\" Nevertheless, until the recent breakup, she said she had always thought of herself as \"fine.\" She had been successful at work, jogged daily, maintained a solid network of friends, and had \"no real complaints.\"  On initial interview, Ms. Isaac said she had been sad for a few weeks after her boyfriend left, but denied ever having felt worthless, guilty, hopeless, anhedonic, or suicidal. She said her weight was unchanged and her sleep was fine. The patient denied psychomotor changes. She did describe significant anxiety, with a Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 score of 18, indicating severe anxiety.",
         "Discussion\t Ms. Isaac has become edgy, easily fatigued, and excessively worried during the 8 months since her boyfriend broke up with her. She has difficulty focusing. Her worries cause distress and dysfunction and lead her to repeatedly seek out reassurance. Although some of these symptoms could also be attributable to a depressive disorder, she lacks most other symptoms of major depressive disorder. Instead, Ms. Isaac meets criteria for DSM-5 generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).  More acutely, Ms. Isaac has developed intense anxiety about leaving her apartment and entering the local supermarket. These symptoms suggest that Ms. Isaac may meet DSM-5 criteria for agoraphobia, which requires fears and avoidance of at least two different situations. Her agoraphobia symptoms have persisted only a few months, however, which is less than the 6-month DSM-5 requirement. Depending on whether the clinician thought the agoraphobia symptoms warranted clinical attention, Ms. Isaac could receive an additional diagnosis of \"unspecified anxiety disorder (agoraphobia with inadequate duration of symptoms).\" GAD is common, with a lifetime prevalence of 5.7% in the community and approximately 8% in primary care settings, where patients may present with physical symptoms (e.g., headaches, gastrointestinal issues, musculoskeletal pain). Cognitive-behavioral therapy and/or medication (e.g., a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor) will likely improve Ms. Isaac's symptoms. She may also wish to explore what might have precipitated her GAD. Although it is not possible to be certain why someone develops a mood or anxiety disorder, consideration of psychosocial stressors that are coincident with the onset of symptoms can help with formulation, goal setting, and treatment. In this case, Ms. Isaac developed acute anxiety symptoms after her live-in boyfriend broke up with her and she moved into another apartment. Both of these events were acutely upsetting. The next part of answering \"Why now?\" involves thinking about how the stressors relate to long-standing issues in Ms. Isaac's life. She noted that she had \"never [been] single for very long,\" and gave a history of difficulties with separation that began in childhood. Anxiety that is triggered by separation may suggest problems with  attachment, and adult attachment styles are thought to be linked to a person's earliest relationships. Those with secure attachments are able to form intimate relationships with others but are also able to soothe and regulate themselves when alone. Individuals with insecure attachments, on the other hand, may cling to loved ones, be unable to self-regulate when alone, and have ambivalent feelings about those upon whom they are dependent. Thinking in this way, one can hypothesize that Ms. Isaac may have become symptomatic because of an insecure attachment style linked to her earliest relationship with her mother. Clues that this may be the case include her mother's feeling that Ms. Isaac was \"too clingy\" during the divorce and Ms. Isaac's ambivalent feelings about her mother's efforts to be supportive. It would be helpful to understand more about Ms. Isaac's earliest relationships and the sorts of problematic attachment patterns that have developed during her romantic relationships. Such patterns would likely be recapitulated in the therapeutic relationship, where they could become a focus of treatment.",

         "Andrea DiMartini, M.D.  Catherine Crone, M.D.  A psychiatric transplant liaison service was called to evaluate Robert Jennings, a 50- year-old married white man, for a liver transplant in the context of an alcohol use disorder, advanced cirrhosis, and no other prior psychiatric history. Several weeks earlier, he had been hospitalized with acute alcohol-associated hepatitis and diagnosed with end-stage liver disease. Prednisolone 40 mg/day was prescribed for treatment of the hepatitis. Prior to that hospitalization, he had been unaware that his alcohol consumption was seriously damaging his health and was shocked to learn that he would eventually require a liver transplant. Upon discharge, he began an addiction treatment program that was mandatory for him to be listed for possible transplantation.  Outpatient psychiatric consultation was requested by the transplant team after the patient's family expressed concern that he had recently become increasingly irritable and anxious and seemed to be having difficulty coping with the requirements for transplantation. Mr. Jennings's primary care physician had recently prescribed alprazolam 0.5 mg as needed for his anxiety. This was initially helpful, but after several days his family noticed he seemed more irritable, lethargic, and forgetful. When interviewed, the patient said that he had been tired for months prior to the diagnosis and that the fatigue had hampered his ability to work (his job required making deliveries for a shipping firm). Although the diagnosis had been a shock, he said he had left the hospital feeling \"great, better than I'd felt in years.\" For about a week after discharge, he described having enhanced energy and a sense of well-being, but he then began to feel anxious and restless. He slept poorly, unable to concentrate, and worried constantly about his health, finances, and family. He became less engaged with his family and stopped watching movies, normally his favorite pastime. He denied having nightmares, flashbacks, avoidant behaviors, or racing thoughts. He also denied low mood, tearfulness, appetite changes, anhedonia, helplessness, hopelessness, or suicidality. He reported that he had started drinking daily 10 years earlier, stating that he enjoyed the taste of beer and liked socializing with friends after work. He developed tolerance to alcohol, needing to consume six to eight drinks per night to achieve the same effect. He described some withdrawal symptoms in the  morning but did not drink during work hours; he underwent random testing due to his job as a truck driver. He did miss some family activities, preferring to drink, and this had been a source of marital conflict. He admitted feeling guilty about his alcohol use and its impact on him and his family. He denied using any alcohol since his hospitalization. He admitted to anger over having to undergo addiction counseling and had argued with the transplant team about this requirement. He denied having been an anxious person and considered himself able to handle most of life's challenges without being overwhelmed. His family confirmed his description of himself and viewed his recent behavior as uncharacteristic. On mental status examination, Mr. Jennings was a thin, jaundiced, tired-appearing man. His gait was normal, but he was fidgety while seated. He maintained eye contact and responded appropriately, although he repeatedly made comments like, \"Something isn't right\" and \"It's not all in my head.\" His affect was anxious and irritable, and his speech was terse. He appeared distracted but denied confusion and disorientation. He had no delusions or hallucinations. His thoughts were logical and coherent, without disorganization, and there was no latency to his responses. He scored 26 out of 30 on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, missing points for recall and serial 7s. He scored in the normal range for Trail Making Test A and B but asked to have the instructions repeated for Trails B.",
         "Discussion Mr. Jennings has been fatigued for several months. Diagnosis and treatment of his hepatic cirrhosis were followed by a weeklong burst of euphoria, followed by anxiety, irritability, cognitive disturbances, and insomnia. The evaluating team would look broadly for causes of Mr. Jennings's psychiatric complaints, but the initial search would focus on medical causes. Liver disease rarely induces anxiety directly, but he did receive prednisolone while in the hospital, and steroid therapy frequently induces an initial sense of well-being, followed within 1-2 weeks by more negative or unpleasant symptoms of mood or anxiety disturbance.  Other diagnoses should also be considered. Fatigue, difficulty concentrating, and a reduction in pleasurable activities point to the possibility of major depressive disorder,  for example, although some of these symptoms could be attributable to progressive physical limitations from his advanced liver disease. Utilizing a broad or \"inclusive\" approach to the diagnosis of depression in medically ill patients might suggest that these symptoms be counted under the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder despite their potential physical origin. However, further review of Mr. Jennings's presentation indicated that although he complained of feeling irritable, he had no problems with persistent low mood, tearfulness, or other associated depressive symptoms (e.g., anhedonia, appetite changes, inappropriate thoughts of guilt, or recurrent thoughts of death or suicide). Major depressive disorder would seem unlikely.  Anxiety disorders such as generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder should also be considered. It could be that the discontinuation of his alcohol use has led to the unmasking of an underlying anxiety disorder. However, Mr. Jennings denied having past symptoms of anxiety and reported drinking for pleasure and to socialize; he did not appear to be drinking to manage anxiety or stress. In addition, his symptoms seem directly related to the steroids and lack the duration to qualify for one of the other anxiety disorders. Illness, treatments, and potentially life-threatening circumstances can lead to acute stress disorder, adjustment disorder, and PTSD. Although he does have symptoms of heightened arousal and reactivity, Mr. Jennings denies intrusive recollections or avoidance behaviors. He does not, therefore, meet criteria for a trauma-related disorder. Furthermore, it is notable that he initially felt well despite his diagnosis and only later developed changes in his mood and behavior. This pattern would not rule out a trauma diagnosis but does reduce its likelihood. An additionally important diagnostic area to consider is Mr. Jennings's dependence on alcohol. Early in abstinence, patients often experience symptoms of anxiety, irritability, and depression. These symptoms contribute to the high rates of relapse following alcohol rehabilitation. Even in the context of life-threatening illness and the need for transplantation, a significant number of individuals relapse. Although it may be tempting to prescribe benzodiazepines to treat anxiety symptoms, these medications can produce cravings and precipitate relapse, and should be avoided. This patient is denying alcohol use, but he is on a transplant list, and a relapse could lead to a delisting. To  monitor unrevealed alcohol use, it would be warranted to monitor him by ongoing interviews and random toxicology screenings. Mr. Jennings's current presentation could also be related to a neurocognitive disorder. Patients with advanced liver disease frequently have problems with minimal hepatic encephalopathy, a phenomenon that is characterized by subtle but important changes in both physical and mental functioning. Compared with hepatic encephalopathy (DSM-5 delirium due to another medical condition), minimal hepatic encephalopathy does not present with disturbance of consciousness or with overt behavioral or cognitive functioning changes. Rather, patients may present with mild personality or behavioral changes such as irritability, excessive fatigue, or sleepiness, along with subtle subcortical cognitive impairment or slowing. Impairments in psychomotor speed, visual attention, and perception are typically not evident with basic screening such as the Montreal Cognitive Assessment but require specific psychometric testing that would elicit these deficits (e.g., Trail Making Test A and B, Digit Span, finger-tapping speed).  Identifying minimal hepatic encephalopathy is important because patients with this diagnosis typically do not improve with the use of antidepressants or anxiolytics but instead require treatment with ammonia-reducing agents. The combination of minimal hepatic encephalopathy and slower hepatic metabolism makes patients more sensitive to adverse drug side effects (e.g., cognitive slowing from benzodiazepines, sedatives, pain medications, or anticholinergic medications). In Mr. Jennings's case, the worsening of symptoms may have resulted from the use of a benzodiazepine. These patients need to avoid medications that may worsen cognitive functioning, and they should also be monitored for development of overt hepatic encephalopathy. Because cognitive difficulties that accompany minimal hepatic encephalopathy are known to impair daily functioning and skills such as driving, this patient may need to be counseled on whether he can or should continue to drive (which would have significant implications for his work as a deliveryman). After discontinuing the alprazolam and receiving treatment for high ammonia levels (if present), he could be retested to establish his cognitive baseline.",

Barnhill, M.D.  When evaluating a patient whose preoccupations and rituals have become persistent, excessive, and impairing, clinicians are encouraged to consider each of the disorders within the chapter on obsessive-compulsive and related disorders. These include obsessive-compulsive disorder, body dysmorphic disorder, hoarding disorder, trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder), and excoriation (skin-picking) disorder. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by the presence of obsessions and/or compulsions. Obsessions are unwanted and repetitive thoughts that often involve such concerns as pathological doubt, fear of contamination, somatic concerns, and a need for symmetry. Compulsions are the repetitive behaviors that are performed in response to the distress of the obsessions. Common compulsive behaviors include checking, ordering, cleaning, and mental rituals. Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is characterized by a preoccupation with one or more  physical flaws that are not readily apparent to others. In addition, a diagnosis of BDD requires repetitive behaviors (such as excessive grooming or reassurance seeking) and significant distress or dysfunction. If the preoccupation is primarily about weight, however, then that patient would receive an eating disorder diagnosis if diagnostic criteria for an eating disorder are met. Once a diagnosis is made, DSM-5 includes multiple specifiers for many of its diagnoses. OCD, BDD, and hoarding disorder are unusual in having an \"insight\" specifier. The insight specifier characterizes patients as having good or fair insight, poor insight, or absent insight/delusional beliefs. For example, people who are delusionally convinced that their BDD beliefs are true would not be coded as having a comorbid psychotic disorder (e.g., delusional disorder) but would instead be noted to have BDD with absent insight. Trichotillomania (hair-pulling), and excoriation (skin-picking) are the most common body-focused, repetitive behavior disorders. Hair-pulling disorder was previously listed among the impulse-control disorders not elsewhere classified, along with such disorders as pyromania and intermittent explosive disorder. Skin-picking disorder was new in DSM-5. Both disorders involve the sort of persistent, repetitive dysfunctional behaviors that characterize all of the obsessive-compulsive and related disorders. Hoarding disorder was also new in DSM-5. It was previously listed as a possible criterion for obsessive-compulsive personality disorder or considered a symptom of OCD. In some cases, hoarding-type behavior is a symptom of OCD (e.g., if trash accumulates because of fears of becoming contaminated by touching it), but evidence indicates that dysfunctional hoarding often exists without an accompanying OCD diagnosis. As continues to be true throughout much of DSM-5, this chapter includes categories for patients whose symptoms are assessed to be secondary to medications, substances, or another medical condition. DSM-5 also allows clinicians to identify clinically relevant conditions that do not meet full criteria for a disorder. For example, a presentation that meets criteria for body dysmorphic disorder in a person who has significant physical flaws-a circumstance that would preclude the use of that diagnosis (which requires that any physical flaws be no more than \"slight\")-could be recorded as \"other specified  obsessive-compulsive and related disorder (body dysmorphic-like disorder with actual flaws).\" The \"other specified\" diagnosis might also be used to refer to a symptom cluster not described in the criteria for any DSM-5 obsessive-compulsive and related disorder, such as obsessional jealousy or olfactory reference disorder. \"Unspecified\" disorders can refer to symptom clusters that resemble presentations found in a particular DSM-5 chapter but that do not meet criteria for any specific disorder; the unspecified diagnosis is often used when the clinician has insufficient clinical information to make a diagnosis, such as in an emergency evaluation or an initial consultation.

         "Mayumi Okuda, M.D.  Helen Blair Simpson, M.D., Ph.D.  Samuel King, a 52-year-old never-married janitor, presented for treatment of depression. He had been struggling with depressive symptoms for years and had tried fluoxetine, citalopram, and supportive psychotherapy, with minor improvement. He worked full-time but engaged in very few activities outside of work. When asked how he felt, Mr. King said that his mood was low, he was unable to enjoy things, and he had insomnia, feelings of hopelessness, low energy, and difficulty concentrating and making decisions. He denied current suicidality but added that a few years earlier, he had taken a full bottle of medication with the intent to kill himself. He reported that he had done this during a time that he was abusing alcohol. He denied current alcohol or illicit substance use.  When asked about anxiety, Mr. King said he was worried about contracting diseases such as HIV. Aware of an unusually strong disinfectant smell, the interviewer asked the patient if he had any particular cleaning behaviors related to the HIV concerns. Mr. King paused and clarified that he avoided touching practically anything outside of his home. When further encouraged, Mr. King said that if he even came close to things that he considered potentially contaminated, he had to wash his hands incessantly with household bleach. He described that he felt like \"something was still there\" in his hands and he had to wash his hands until it felt that he had finally done it \"right.\" On average, Mr. King washed his hands up to 30 times a day, spending hours on this routine. Physical contact was particularly difficult. Shopping for groceries and taking public transportation were a big problem, and he had almost given up trying to socialize or engage in romantic relationships. These behaviors had only intensified during the COVID-19 pandemic, though a co-worker liked to joke that Mr. King had been cleaning and social distancing for years before it became fashionable. When asked if he had other worries, Mr. King replied that he had intrusive images of hitting someone, fears that he would say things that might be offensive or inaccurate, and concerns about disturbing his neighbors. To counteract the anxiety produced by these images and thoughts, he constantly replayed prior conversations in his mind, kept diaries to record what he said, and often apologized for fear he might have sounded offensive. When he showered, he made sure that the water in the tub only reached a certain level for fear that if he were not attentive, he would flood his neighbors. Mr. King used gloves at work and performed well. He had no medical problems. He spent most of his free time at home. Although he enjoyed the company of others, the fear of having to touch something if he was invited to a meal or to another person's home was too much for him to handle. The examination revealed a casually dressed man who smelled strongly of bleach. He was worried and constricted but cooperative, coherent, and goal directed. He denied hallucinations and other strongly held ideas. He denied a current intention to hurt himself or others. He was cognitively intact. He recognized that his fears and urges were \"kinda crazy,\" but he felt they were out of his control.",
         "Discussion\t Mr. King has prominent depressive symptoms as well as obsessions and compulsions. He reports dysphoria, anhedonia, insomnia, hopelessness, anergia, and difficulty concentrating. Although he denies current suicidal thoughts, he has a history of a suicide attempt. These symptoms have persisted much longer than the required 2 weeks, have affected the quality of his life, and do not appear to have been precipitated by substance use or a medical problem. He clearly warrants a major depressive disorder diagnosis. Evaluation for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) can be less straightforward. Mr. King discussed both his obsessions and his compulsions in a first session, but many patients are less spontaneously revealing. For that reason, an assessment for possible OCD requires specific, tactful questions that can allow people with varying levels of insight to discuss thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that can be embarrassing and private. DSM-5 defined obsessions as having two related qualities: First, they are recurrent, persistent thoughts, urges, or images that are intrusive and unwanted and generally induce anxiety or distress. Second, the individual tries to ignore, suppress, or neutralize these symptoms through some other thought or action (i.e., by enacting a compulsion). Mr. King reports multiple obsessions. These include obsessions related to contamination (fear of contracting HIV), aggression (intrusive images of hitting someone), scrupulosity (fear of sounding offensive or inaccurate), and symmetry (exactness in the level of water). He also experienced sensory phenomena, preceding the compulsion to wash his hands; he described a physical sensation of feeling that his hands were contaminated and described a just-right sensation. Attempts to ignore or suppress the thoughts, urges, or images can take the form of avoidance and lead to significant disability. This is certainly true for Mr. King, who spends hours on his OCD routines and avoids leaving his apartment, engaging in social relationships, and performing the most basic of errands. DSM-5 made several minor changes to the description of obsessions. For example, the term urge is used instead of impulse to avoid confusion with impulse-control disorders.  DSM-5 also used the term unwanted instead of inappropriate to reflect the reality that people with OCD view their symptoms with varying degrees of ego-dystonicity. Finally, although obsessions are noted to generally cause anxiety or distress, research indicates that not all obsessions result in significant anxiety or distress. Mr. King also has a number of compulsions. Compulsions are defined as repetitive behaviors (e.g., hand washing) or mental acts (e.g., counting) that the individual feels driven to perform in response to an obsession, or according to rules that must be rigidly applied. These behaviors or mental acts must be aimed at reducing distress or preventing some dreaded event, but they should also be either excessive or realistically unconnected to the anticipated event. He reports multiple compulsions: excessive hand washing, checking (keeping diaries), repeating (clarifying what he said repeatedly), and mental compulsions (replaying prior conversations in his mind). As is seen for disorders throughout DSM-5, the OCD diagnosis requires that symptoms cause distress or impairment. Typically, OCD is time-consuming (1 hour per day is a guideline) and causes distress and impairment in multiple spheres of the patient's life. Even though Mr. King is able to work, his choice of occupation might have been influenced by his OCD symptoms (few other jobs allow the constant wearing of gloves and frequent use of bleach). Not only are his symptoms time-consuming, but he appears to be a lonely, isolated man, whose life has been significantly ravaged by his OCD. It is important to explore whether OCD symptoms can be attributable to a substance, a medication, a medical condition, or a comorbid psychiatric condition. From the history, it appears that Mr. King takes no medications, abuses no substances, has no medical illness, and lacks actual physical complaints. None of these seem to be likely contributors. Recurrent thoughts and repetitive behavior can be found in a variety of other psychiatric diagnoses. To exclude these other diagnoses, the clinician should ask the patient a series of very specific questions. For example, recurrent thoughts, avoidant behaviors, and repetitive requests for reassurance can also occur in anxiety disorders (e.g., generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder). The obsessions of OCD must also be distinguished from the rumination of major depressive disorder, in which thoughts are  usually mood congruent and not necessarily experienced as intrusive or distressing. When OCD is identified, it is useful to specifically explore the possibility of OCD-related disorders (e.g., body dysmorphic disorder, hoarding disorder), which can present similarly to OCD and can also be co-occurring. In an effort to subcategorize OCD symptoms, the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria listed two specifiers. The first identifies those OCD patients who also have a past or current history of a tic disorder; data suggest that OCD patients with a history of tic disorders may have a different clinical course and response to treatments than OCD patients without a history of tics. A second DSM-5 specifier relates to insight, which varies significantly among different people with OCD. The three insight specifiers are good or fair; poor; and absent. Mr. King appears to understand that his obsessional beliefs are untrue and so would fall into the most insightful category. Individuals who are completely convinced of the validity of their OCD beliefs would previously have been viewed as delusional, but DSM-5 integrated this cluster of people into the OCD diagnosis with the specifier \"with absent insight/delusional beliefs.\"",

         "Dan J. Stein, M.D., Ph.D.  Helen Blair Simpson, M.D., Ph.D. Katharine A. Phillips, M.D. Trevor Lewis, a 32-year-old single man living with his parents, was brought to his psychiatric consultation by his mother. She noted that since adolescence, her son had been concerned with germs, which led to long-standing hand-washing and showering rituals. During the prior 6 months, his symptoms had markedly worsened. He had become preoccupied with being infected by COVID-19 and spent the day cleaning not only his body but all of his clothing and linen. He had begun to insist that the family also wash their clothing and linen regularly, and that they keep the windows shut all the time. He allowed no visitors to their home. When the parents were occasionally exposed to other people by going outside, he insisted that they wear their masks in his presence for the ensuing 48 hours. The resulting conflicts had led to the current consultation.  Mr. Lewis had in the past received a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and cognitive- behavioral therapy for his symptoms. These had had some positive effects, and he had been able to complete high school successfully. Nevertheless, his symptoms had prevented him from completing college or working outside the home; he had long felt that his home was relatively germ-free in comparison to the outside world. However, over the past 6 months, he had increasingly indicated that home, too, was contaminated, including with COVID-19. At the time of presentation, Mr. Lewis had no other obsessive-compulsive and related disorder symptoms such as sexual, religious, or other obsessions; appearance or  acquisition preoccupations; or body-focused repetitive behaviors. However, in the past he had also experienced obsessions relating to fears of harming himself or others, together with associated checking compulsions (e.g., checking that the stove was switched off). He had a childhood history of motor tics. During high school, he found that marijuana reduced his anxiety. He denied having had access to marijuana and other psychoactive substances since leaving school. Mr. Lewis was interviewed over video using a telehealth system. He appeared disheveled and unkempt. He was completely convinced that COVID-19 had contaminated his home and that his washing and cleaning were necessary to stay uninfected. When challenged with information about COVID-19's mode of spread, he answered that COVID-19 might come into the home through an open window or the sweat of visitors, and his masked parents could certainly get infected by going to the grocery store. He added that his parents had tried to convince him that he was excessively worried, but he did not believe them. In fact, his worries kept returning even when he tried to think of something else.  There was no evidence of hallucinations or of a formal thought disorder. He denied an intention to harm or kill himself or others. He was cognitively intact.",
         "Discussion Mr. Lewis is completely convinced that his home is contaminated by COVID-19. He is unable to suppress these preoccupying, intrusive thoughts. He feels obliged to perform unreasonable behaviors in response to his excessive worries. These behaviors consume his day and are socially and occupationally debilitating. He meets the symptomatic criteria for DSM-5 obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Contamination and cleanliness concerns, with subsequent washing and cleaning rituals, are a common symptom dimension in OCD. DSM-5 listed two specifiers for OCD. The tic-related OCD specifier is based on a growing literature indicating that individuals with OCD and current or past tics have particular distinguishing features, and that the presence or absence of tics helps guide assessment and intervention. Mr. Lewis had a history of motor tics in childhood. DSM-5 also recommends an assessment of insight, particularly specifying whether the individual with OCD has good or fair insight, poor insight, or absent insight/delusional beliefs. The  \"with absent insight/delusional beliefs\" specifier is provided not only for OCD but also for body dysmorphic disorder and hoarding disorder, and appears to be a valid, clinically useful distinguishing feature. Obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviors are found in other psychiatric disorders. Patients with illness anxiety disorder (IAD) are preoccupied with having or acquiring a serious illness, and may perform excessive related behaviors, such as seeking reassurance. Mr. Lewis is worried about getting COVID-19, which might prompt the consideration that he has IAD. His cleaning compulsions and checking are more characteristic of OCD, however, and he lacks the somatic symptoms, other health-related concerns, and checking of the body for signs of illness that are commonly found in IAD. Similarly, although patients with generalized anxiety disorder can have worries about their own or others' health, they also have other kinds of worries, and they do not have compulsions.  Patients with delusional disorder do not have the obsessions, compulsions, preoccupations, or other characteristic symptoms of OCD. Conversely, patients with OCD with absent insight/delusional beliefs may appear delusional but do not have other features of psychotic disorders, such as hallucinations or formal thought disorder. Mr. Lewis does not have a substance use or medical history that is associated with psychotic symptoms. It would be useful to have a more detailed picture of the nature and severity of Mr. Lewis's OCD symptoms, including avoidance and functional impairment. Mr. Lewis was noted to be disheveled and unkempt, for example, which might seem odd for someone with prominent cleanliness concerns. His appearance might be explained, however, if his contamination rituals are so time-consuming that he avoids starting them. Although Mr. Lewis's diagnosis appears clear, it can be helpful to make use of one of the symptom severity scales designed for OCD, such as the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale, or a scale to measure insight/delusionality, such as the Brown Assessment of Beliefs Scale.",

         "Katharine A. Phillips, M.D.  Vincent Mancini, a 26-year-old single white man, was brought for an outpatient evaluation by his parents because they were distressed by his symptoms. Since age 13, he had been excessively preoccupied with his \"scarred\" skin, \"thinning\" hair, \"asymmetrical\" ears, and \"wimpy\" and \"inadequately muscular\" body build. Although he looked normal, Mr. Mancini was completely convinced that he looked \"ugly and hideous,\" and he believed that other people talked about him and made fun of him because of his appearance. Mr. Mancini spent 5-6 hours a day compulsively checking his disliked body areas in mirrors and other reflecting surfaces such as windows, excessively styling his hair \"to  create an illusion of fullness,\" pulling on his ears to try to \"even them up,\" and comparing his appearance with that of others. He compulsively picked his skin, sometimes using razor blades, to try to \"clear it up.\" He lifted weights daily and regularly wore several layers of T-shirts to look bigger. He almost always wore a cap to hide his hair. He had received dermatological treatment for his skin concerns but felt it had not helped. Mr. Mancini missed several months of high school because he was too preoccupied to do schoolwork, felt compelled to leave class to check mirrors, and was too self-conscious to be seen by others; for these reasons, he was unable to attend college. He became socially withdrawn and did not date \"because no girl would want to go out with someone as ugly as me.\" He often considered suicide because he felt that life was not worth living \"if I look like a freak\" and because he felt isolated and ostracized because of his \"ugliness.\" His parents expressed concern over his \"violent outbursts,\" which occurred when he was feeling especially angry and distressed over how he looked or when they tried to pull him away from the mirror.  Mr. Mancini reported depressed mood, anhedonia, worthlessness, poor concentration, and suicidal ideation, all of which he attributed to his appearance concerns. To self- medicate his distress over his appearance, he drank alcohol and smoked marijuana. He used protein powder to \"build up muscle\" but denied use of anabolic steroids or other performance-enhancing drugs or drugs of abuse. He had distressing and problematic anxiety in social situations during his late teens that he attributed to feeling \"stupid,\" but he denied recent social anxiety that was unrelated to his appearance concerns. Mr. Mancini had no significant medical history and was taking no medication. His mother had obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Mr. Mancini was neatly dressed and groomed and wore a baseball cap. He had no obvious physical defects. His eye contact was poor. He was oriented and grossly cognitively intact. His affect was irritable; his mood was depressed, with passive suicidal ideation. He had no psychomotor abnormalities; his speech was normal. He was completely convinced that he was ugly and was certain that other people talked about him and laughed at him because of his physical appearance; he had no other psychotic  symptoms. He believed his appearance \"defects\" were real and not attributable to a psychiatric disorder.",
         "Discussion Mr. Mancini is preoccupied with perceived defects or flaws in his appearance that are not observable or appear only slight to others. In response to his appearance concerns, he performs repetitive behaviors, including compulsively checking his disliked body areas in mirrors and other reflecting surfaces, excessively styling his hair, pulling on his ears, and picking his skin; he also performs repetitive mental acts (i.e., comparing his appearance with that of other people). The preoccupation causes clinically significant distress and functional impairment. According to DSM-5, Mr. Mancini has body dysmorphic disorder (BDD). BDD is common and affects slightly more females than males. About two-thirds of cases have onset in childhood or adolescence. BDD can involve any body area (often the face or head) and usually involves multiple areas. Preoccupations occur, on average, for 3-8 hours a day. Over the disorder's course, all individuals perform repetitive behaviors or repetitive mental acts (e.g., comparing) intended to fix, check, hide, or obtain reassurance about their perceived defects. Skin picking, intended to improve perceived skin defects, is a common BDD symptom. In such cases, BDD is diagnosed rather than excoriation (skin-picking) disorder. The appearance preoccupations usually cause functional impairment, which is often marked. Approximately 80% of BDD patients have lifetime suicidal ideation, which often is attributed to BDD, and a quarter or more attempt suicide. Suicidality appears to be more common in BDD than in many other severe psychiatric disorders. Available data, although limited, suggest a markedly elevated suicide rate. Aggressive or violent behavior can occur as a symptom of BDD. BDD's diagnostic criteria include specifiers indicating degree of insight regarding BDD beliefs: with good or fair insight, with poor insight, and with absent insight/delusional beliefs. Mr. Mancini has absent insight/delusional beliefs because he is completely convinced that he looks ugly. Poor insight is the most common level of insight, and about one-third of individuals diagnosed with BDD have delusional beliefs. Those with  delusional BDD beliefs should be diagnosed with BDD rather than a psychotic disorder. Mr. Mancini has BDD-specific delusions of reference; ideas or delusions of reference are present in the majority of individuals with BDD. Other psychotic symptoms typically do not occur as symptoms of BDD. The diagnostic criteria for BDD also include a specifier for muscle dysmorphia, consisting of preoccupation with the idea that one's body build is too small or insufficiently muscular. This specifier is used even if the person is preoccupied with other body areas. Thus, Mr. Mancini's diagnosis includes this specifier. Muscle dysmorphia is considered a form of BDD rather than an eating disorder, because it meets diagnostic criteria for BDD and not all individuals with muscle dysmorphia have abnormal eating behavior. BDD shares preoccupations, obsessions, and repetitive behaviors with OCD, but BDD specifically involves perceived appearance flaws. Symmetry preoccupation, which may be an OCD symptom, should be considered a BDD symptom when it involves physical appearance, as in Mr. Mancini's case. BDD and OCD are related disorders-and Mr. Mancini's mother is noted to have OCD-but they have important differences. Differences include poorer insight, more frequent ideas and delusions of reference, and greater suicidality in BDD; greater comorbidity of BDD with major depressive disorder and possibly substance-related disorders; and differences in some of the approaches used in cognitive-behavioral therapy for the two conditions. Major depressive disorder is the most common co-occurring disorder, often developing secondary to the distress and impairment caused by BDD. Both BDD and major depressive disorder should be diagnosed if criteria are met for both disorders. When social anxiety and avoidance are attributable to preoccupation with perceived appearance defects, BDD should be diagnosed rather than social anxiety disorder. Social anxiety and avoidance are nearly universal in BDD and are due to these individuals' beliefs or fear that they will be considered ugly, ridiculed, or rejected because of their physical features. However, co-occurring social anxiety disorder is present in more than one-third of individuals with BDD. Mr. Mancini was previously diagnosed with social anxiety disorder because he had social anxiety in high school that was not attributable to  his appearance concerns.  Substance use disorders occur in a substantial proportion of individuals with BDD, often as the result of the distress caused by BDD. Mr. Mancini admitted to use of both marijuana and alcohol, although it is not clear whether their use reaches criteria for substance use disorder. From about 20% to more than 40% of people with the muscle dysmorphia form of BDD abuse anabolic-androgenic steroids, which may have dangerous physical and psychological effects. Mr. Mancini denied use of these drugs, but his \"violent outbursts\" could reflect steroid use that he declined to mention during his initial evaluation.",

         "David Mataix-Cols, Ph.D.  Lorena Fern๏ฟฝndez de la Cruz, Ph.D.  Wendy Nichols was a 47-year-old single white woman referred to a community mental health care team for the management of a mixed presentation of low mood and generalized anxiety. She had never taken any psychiatric medication but had completed  a course of cognitive-behavioral therapy for a previous depressive episode 5 years earlier.  Ms. Nichols's medical history was unremarkable. She lived alone in a two-bedroom apartment and had no family or friends nearby. She had a university degree and worked as a part-time sales assistant in a charity thrift shop. She said she had dated in college but had \"somehow been too busy\" in recent years. On initial examination, she was an articulate, well-dressed woman who was coherent and cooperative. She was clearly in a low mood. She complained about poor concentration and difficulties getting organized. She denied any substance misuse. The clinician noted that Ms. Nichols's purse was filled with bills and other papers. When asked, the patient initially shrugged it off, indicating that she \"carried around my office.\" When the interviewer inquired further, it emerged that Ms. Nichols had had difficulty discarding important business papers, newspapers, and magazines for as long as she could remember. She felt that it all started when her mother got rid of her old toys when she was age 12. Now, many years later, Ms. Nichols's apartment had become filled with books, stationery, crafts, plastic packages, cardboard boxes, and all sorts of other things. She said she knew it was a little crazy, but these items could be handy one day. She said, \"Waste not, want not.\" She also reported that many of her possessions were beautiful, unique, and irreplaceable, or had strong sentimental value. The thought of discarding any of these possessions caused her great distress.  Over a series of interviews, the clinician developed a clearer understanding of the extent of the problem. Rooms in Ms. Nichols's apartment had begun to fill when she was in her early 30s, and by the time of the interview, she had little room to live. Her kitchen was almost entirely full, so she used a mini fridge and a toaster oven that she had wedged into piles of paper in the hallway. She ate her meals in the only available chair. At night, she moved a pile of papers from the bed onto that chair so she could sleep. Ms. Nichols continued to buy from the charity thrift store where she worked and also picked up daily free newspapers that she planned to read in the future.  Embarrassed by the condition of her apartment, she had told no one about her behavior and had invited no one into her apartment for at least 15 years. She also avoided social functions and dating, because-despite being naturally sociable and very lonely-she  knew she would be unable to reciprocate with invitations to her home. She was surprised to have told the clinician, because she had not told even her own mother, but she would like help. She declined the clinician's offer of a home visit or a telehealth visit but did offer some photographs of her living room from her telephone's camera. The photographs showed furniture, papers, boxes, and clothes piled from floor to ceiling. Ms. Nichols described long-standing feelings of sadness and loneliness, as well as anxiety whenever she tried to clean up or whenever someone tried to befriend her. She denied other psychiatric symptoms, including delusions, hallucinations, obsessions, and compulsive behavior.",
         "Discussion Ms. Nichols has hoarding disorder, a diagnosis first introduced in DSM-5. She has had difficulty discarding possessions for as long as she can remember. Concerned about perceived future use for the items and sentimental attachment, she experiences severe distress at the thought of discarding any of her possessions. These difficulties have resulted in a living space that is barely functional. Apart from the loss of functionality of her home, she is distressed about her social isolation. The case report does not provide evidence that either a medical disorder or another psychiatric condition is responsible for the hoarding behavior.  It is useful to recognize that valuable items are often intermingled with useless or valueless items, so that jewelry and legal documents can be sandwiched between yellowed newspapers. Knowing such details helps the clinician ask the right questions, which is especially useful in trying to elicit history from a patient who is likely to be embarrassed about the behavior. It can be useful to document clutter through the use of photographs, videos, or a home visit. Home visits are recommended for a full evaluation of any potential risks associated with the disorder, such as fire risks or other health hazards. DSM-5 lists two specifiers for hoarding disorder. The \"excessive acquisition\" specifier refers to the excessive obtaining of items, whether they be free, bought, or stolen, when clearly these items are not needed or there is no space for them. Because many people with hoarding disorder lack insight into their difficulties, the diagnosis of hoarding  disorder includes a specifier for level of insight. Ms. Nichols indicates that her acquisitions and hoarding are reasonable (the items might be useful or have monetary or sentimental value). She has never told her family, much less gone for previous treatment. Ms. Nichols understands that she has a problem and says she wants help, however, so she would be said to have good or fair insight. It is important to explore whether the accumulation of objects is judged to be a direct consequence of another DSM-5 disorder. If so, hoarding disorder is not diagnosed. For example, excessive accumulation of possessions has been described in obsessive- compulsive disorder and a number of neurodevelopmental (e.g., autism spectrum disorder), neurocognitive (e.g., frontotemporal dementia), and psychotic (e.g., schizophrenia) disorders. None of these other diagnoses seems to fit Ms. Nichols. The decreased energy in major depressive disorder can lead to messy accumulation, and Ms. Nichols does appear to have a depression. Not only does the case report not go into enough detail to clarify the depression diagnosis (hence, the DSM-5 diagnosis of unspecified depressive disorder), the nearly lifelong hoarding difficulties appear to have preceded her mood symptoms. Thus, hoarding disorder should be diagnosed along with Ms. Nichols's unspecified depressive disorder.",

         "Dan J. Stein, M.D., Ph.D.  Zoe Oliver was a 22-year-old single woman who presented to her general practitioner after reading a magazine article about trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder). She had never previously told anyone other than her mother about her hair pulling, but the magazine had indicated that it was fairly common and treatable. She was pessimistic that anything would work, but she and her mother agreed that she should seek help. Ms. Oliver's hair pulling most often took place as a ritual when she returned home from her job as a paralegal. She would search for hairs of a particular texture from the crown of her head (though she also pulled from her eyebrows, eyelashes, and pubic region). She felt intense relief if the hair came out with its root. She would then typically bite off the root of the hair and swallow the rest of the hair. She had never experienced any gastrointestinal symptoms after hair swallowing. She said the hair pulling had begun at age 12, and she had never known anyone with similar behaviors. Ms. Oliver fought hard to stop the behavior and, at times, had been able to stop for several months at a time. When the hair pulling returned, she would again feel ashamed and angry at herself. Scarves and hats covered the bald patch, but she would usually withdraw from friends and boyfriends to avoid being caught. Even when demoralized about the behavior, Ms. Oliver did not have vegetative symptoms of depression. Aside from fears of being found out, she lacked prominent anxiety. She denied obsessions, compulsions, hoarding, tics, and preoccupations with either bodily defects or having an illness. She also had no history of a range of other body-focused repetitive behaviors, such as lip biting or cheek chewing, in either herself  or her close family members.  When asked what she would do if she could not find the \"right\" kind of hair to pull, she admitted that she would often pick at her skin or at a scab. The scab's coming off in just the right way led to a feeling of relief that was similar to that which she experienced when hair pulling. She would also sometimes chew and swallow her scabs. Ms. Oliver often picked at scabs on her back so that the lesions would not be easily visible to others. Nevertheless, the resultant scarring did lead her to avoid situations like beach parties and dates and other situations where her behavior might be exposed.",
         "Discussion Ms. Oliver likely meets the diagnostic criteria for both DSM-5 trichotillomania (hair- pulling disorder) and excoriation (skin-picking) disorder. The two disorders are frequently comorbid and have very similar diagnostic criteria. Ms. Oliver pulls out her hair and picks at her skin and scabs, she has made unsuccessful efforts to stop, and both the hair pulling and the skin picking cause significant psychosocial dysfunction. The case report does not indicate that a comorbid condition could be exacerbating either behavior. The diagnoses of trichotillomania and excoriation disorder are frequently missed, both because patients are embarrassed to report symptoms and because clinicians fail to follow up on possible clues, but once the symptoms are clarified, the diagnoses are generally clear-cut.  Although both conditions appear to be having a major impact on her life, Ms. Oliver seems to view her trichotillomania as a more pervasive issue. DSM-5 includes the term hair-pulling disorder as an alternative name for trichotillomania, in much the same way that skin-picking disorder is a synonym for excoriation disorder. Excoriation does describe the behavior, however, whereas the term trichotillomania implies that the hair pulling is a type of mania, which is misleading; thus, many people prefer the term hair- pulling disorder. Ms. Oliver appears to experience tension prior to the hair pulling and skin picking, as well as relief or gratification following the act. Not all individuals with trichotillomania experience such a symptom pattern. In contrast to prior classification systems, including DSM-IV, that categorized trichotillomania as an impulse-control disorder and  emphasized that the condition is characterized by prior tension and subsequent relief or gratification, DSM-5 focuses instead on a history of attempts to decrease the hair pulling. When hair pulling leads to noticeable hair loss, individuals often disguise their bald patches via the use of makeup, scarves, hats, or wigs; therefore, DSM-5 does not require the hair loss to be noticeable. Distress or impairment is emphasized throughout DSM-5, and Ms. Oliver does experience shame and diminished functioning. Ms. Oliver also reports swallowing her hair (trichophagy), which can lead to a trichobezoar and gastrointestinal sequelae, but she does not appear to have experienced any physical complications. Ms. Oliver seeks out a particular type of hair to pull (and scab to pick), and is fully aware when the hair (or scab) is found, pulled, and eaten. Other individuals pull out hair and pick at skin in a more automatic way. Many individuals with trichotillomania and excoriation disorder have a personal or family history of obsessive-compulsive and related disorders. Others, like Ms. Oliver, do not have such a history. Although trichotillomania and excoriation disorder do seem to lie in the obsessive-compulsive spectrum, there are many clinical differences between these two disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorder.  Multiple psychiatric and nonpsychiatric medical conditions can lead to hair pulling and skin picking. If they are found, then they become the primary diagnosis rather than either trichotillomania or skin picking disorder. For example, if the hair- and skin- focused behaviors are related to an appearance preoccupation, the patient is more likely to have body dysmorphic disorder. Hair loss is found in medical conditions ranging from lupus to alopecia areata; if a patient has evident hair loss and denies hair pulling, a medical workup may detect a systemic illness. Delusional parasitosis and tactile hallucinations can lead to skin picking, as can both cocaine intoxication and scabies infestation, but these do not fit the situation with Ms. Oliver. Finally, Ms. Oliver's behavior does not appear to reflect nonsuicidal self-injurious behavior, which can also lead to skin lesions.  It would be useful to have a more detailed understanding of Ms. Oliver's hair-pulling and skin-picking symptoms. Structured interviews can help ensure that possible  comorbidities are recognized, and severity measures may help in the evaluation of these disorders. These instruments can help inform the clinician in regard to both prognosis and treatment. It would also be useful to go beyond the initial report-that Ms. Oliver engages in these behaviors after work to feel better-and better understand pertinent cues and stressors, as well as develop a deeper understanding of the benefits and disadvantages of these behaviors.",

Barnhill, M.D.  The chapter on trauma- and stressor-related disorders consists of a cluster of disorders that require identification of a triggering external event. This was a new chapter in DSM-5. Previously, all of the disorders had been listed in other chapters. This chapter also features the only diagnosis that is new to the main DSM-5-TR text: prolonged grief disorder, which in DSM-5 had been listed in the \"Conditions for Further Study\" chapter in Section III, where it was called persistent complex bereavement disorder. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and acute stress disorder (ASD) were moved from the chapter on anxiety disorders. Both PTSD and ASD are characterized by heterogeneous symptoms, not only anxiety, and one consequence of this classification change was to emphasize the importance of assessing the breadth of reactions to an external trauma or stressor. At the same time, both disorders often present with prominent anxiety, and an alternative conceptualization of both PTSD and ASD would  characterize them on an anxiety spectrum of disorders, alongside, for example, obsessive-compulsive disorder, which was also moved from the anxiety disorders into its own chapter in DSM-5. A PTSD diagnosis requires the presence of symptoms from each of four symptom clusters: intrusion symptoms (previously known as reexperiencing), avoidance symptoms, negative alterations in cognition and mood, and arousal symptoms. DSM-5 more explicitly recognized the heterogeneity of acute post-trauma response by eliminating the requirement that individuals with ASD have symptoms from multiple symptom clusters. Instead, it is necessary to have at least nine of 14 symptoms. In practice, this could mean that one individual with ASD could have all four intrusion symptoms, whereas another might have none.  PTSD and ASD are most clearly delineated by duration, with PTSD persisting at least 1 month after the external event and ASD lasting no more than 1 month. For both PTSD and ASD, the initial stressor criterion now specifies whether the trauma was experienced, witnessed, or experienced indirectly. Unlike DSM-IV, DSM-5 did not require an assessment of the patient's initial subjective response for either disorder. Finally, diagnostic thresholds for PTSD were lowered for children and adolescents, and a preschool subtype was added. Two of the chapter's disorders-reactive attachment disorder (RAD) and disinhibited social engagement disorder (DSED)-are initially found in childhood, although both may have lifelong consequences. Children with RAD have responded to the absence of expectable caregiving by a cluster of withdrawn and inhibited symptoms, whereas those with DSED have symptoms described as indiscriminately social and disinhibited. Adjustment disorder had previously served as a residual category for people who were distressed but did not meet criteria for a more discrete disorder. The adjustment disorders were reconceptualized in DSM-5 as an array of stress-response syndromes that occur after exposure to a distressing event. As in DSM-IV, the adjustment disorders should include a specifier that identifies the predominant disturbance (e.g., depressed mood, anxiety, disturbance of conduct, or a combination). It has long been recognized that it is normal for people to grieve the death of a loved one.  Clinicians and researchers have increasingly identified a subgroup of people whose emotional reaction appears to be excessive in intensity for over a year. The diagnosis of prolonged grief disorder has been introduced within the main body of DSM-5-TR to meet this clinical concern. DSM-5-TR explores the growing evidence that culture affects clinical expression. For example, non-Western groups appear to respond to PTSD with less avoidance and more somatic symptoms such as dizziness and shortness of breath. Although DSM-5-TR emphasizes categories of disorders, it also includes discussion of how developmental issues can affect symptomatology. For example, children younger than 6 years can be traumatized by life-threatening events such as the threat of abandonment, and a primary presenting complaint might be nightmares, with or without traumatic content. The trauma- and stressor-related disorders can usefully bring together seemingly unrelated symptoms. For example, an adult might present with complaints related to anxiety, depression, paranoia, social isolation, and substance use. Without a careful history that looks for trauma, the clinician might conceptualize the patient as having half a dozen diagnoses rather than a single trauma- and stressor-related diagnosis that synthesizes a disparate set of problems. At the same time, comorbidities are common among the disorders discussed in this chapter, and, if found, should generally be identified along with the disorder directly related to the trauma or stress.

         "Daniel S. Schechter, M.D.  Adriana was a 4-year-old girl referred to an early childhood mental health care clinic for evaluation of \"dangerous behaviors.\" The parents were particularly concerned that Adriana maintained poor boundaries, was impulsive, and was too quick to trust strangers. Adriana had been adopted from an Eastern European orphanage at age 29 months. At the time of the adoption, Adriana's medical records were reviewed by a local pediatrician, who found no problems aside from growth parameters that were all below the 5th percentile. When the adoptive parents met her at the orphanage, Adriana approached without shyness and visited easily with them. The parents had been pleasantly reassured by the child's happy demeanor and her spontaneous, warm hugs. Not long after her adoption, Adriana began to clearly seek out her mother for comfort when distressed or hurt. At most other times, however, Adriana did not distinguish between strangers and her family. In the grocery store, she would warmly hug whoever was waiting next to them in line. In group and family settings, she would frequently try to sit in the laps of people she had barely met. Once, at a shopping mall, she tried to leave with another family. Her parents were concerned that this behavior might put her at risk of abduction or abuse. Compared with other children her age, Adriana had trouble taking turns and sitting for circle time at school. She interrupted, intruded into classmates' play space, and occasionally hit others. Small triggers upset her for prolonged periods. She had trouble soothing herself but would generally calm down if held by her teacher or a parent. Adriana lived with her adoptive mother and father and her 12-year-old brother, who was the biological child of her parents. Her mother stayed home for Adriana's first year in the  United States, but Adriana had been attending a half-day child care program for the past year. Her mother noted progress in the child's development, although she remained language delayed, with comprehension better than productive language. She was slower than classmates in developing school readiness skills, but her gross and fine motor skills were considered average. Her sleep and appetite were fine. She had gained weight, but her head circumference remained just below the 5th percentile. On examination, she was a pleasant, well-groomed girl who appeared younger than her age. She spoke little but did appear to pay attention to the interviewer. Within a few minutes, she tried to crawl onto the interviewer's lap.",
         "Discussion Adriana is a preschool-age child who was referred for \"dangerous behaviors\" that relate primarily to excess physical familiarity with strangers. The parents worry that these behaviors place Adriana at risk for predation. The case report also indicates that Adriana has trouble regulating her proximity to other people, both in terms of going too far away from her mother and getting too close to strangers. Even with peers, she \"intruded into classmates' play space.\" The parents apparently felt reassured after first meeting Adriana when she lacked shyness and happily gave them spontaneous, warm hugs. Typically developing children tend to express selective attachment by age 6 or 7 months, however, and show frank reticence in the presence of strangers by age 8 or 9 months. Adriana's seemingly desirable behavior at age 29 months suggests that, in fact, attachment-related psychopathology was already present.  Adriana most likely has a DSM-5 diagnosis of disinhibited social engagement disorder (DSED). In particular, her disinhibited social behaviors cannot be attributed to general impulsivity, and she has all four of the core symptomatic criteria (only two are required): reduced or absent reticence in approaching and interacting with unfamiliar adults; overly familiar behavior; diminished or absent checking back with an adult caregiver after venturing away; and willingness to go off with an unfamiliar adult with minimal or no hesitation.  DSED reflects a change in the diagnostic nomenclature. In DSM-IV, the diagnosis of reactive attachment disorder (RAD) of infancy or early childhood was characterized by a pattern of markedly disturbed and developmentally inappropriate attachment behaviors evident before age 5 years. RAD in DSM-IV was divided into two subtypes: inhibited and indiscriminate. The indiscriminate subtype of RAD was reconceptualized in DSM-5 as disinhibited social engagement disorder, whereas the inhibited form continues to be called reactive attachment disorder. DSM-5 clarified that DSED can be found even among children without disordered attachment-for example, among those who approach their caregiver when stressed or hurt, as Adriana does with her adoptive mother.  Adriana's adoption occurred beyond the age when children typically develop selective attachment. This suggests that she was subject to pathogenic care during a sensitive, if not critical, period of social brain development. For example, a high child-to-caregiver ratio at the orphanage might have limited her opportunities to form selective attachments. One can assume that this early adverse environment, which was likely characterized by neglect, interacted with biological vulnerability. Adriana's inhibitory dyscontrol within social contexts, for example, may indicate abnormalities in the development of the prefrontal and cingulate cortices and related circuits of the brain. Such abnormalities may be associated with risk factors such as prenatal malnutrition or toxicity and/or prematurity, as well as other genetic risk factors.  Adriana also tends to become easily distressed and to have difficulty calming down. Such difficulty with emotion regulation can also be linked to disordered early attachment and pathogenic care. But her ability to self-soothe may also have been affected by her delayed expressive language development, itself an associated feature in support of the diagnosis of DSED according to DSM-5. Also linked to early-even prenatal-pathogenic care is the description of Adriana's early growth parameters as being below the 5th percentile, with persistence of a small head circumference and the possibility of mild cognitive delays affecting school readiness. Although adequate records are unlikely in Adriana's case, it would be useful to explore the possible role of such factors as malnutrition, maternal substance abuse, and fetal alcohol syndrome. It would also be useful to investigate possible comorbidities, which  are frequent in this disorder. For example, some children with DSED also have attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It is useful, however, to recall that although both DSED and ADHD may feature impulsivity, DSED is a specific relationship disorder. Does DSED pathologize outgoing friendliness? The short answer is no. Whereas most young children might smile at or talk to familiar adults, or even unfamiliar adults acknowledged as \"safe\" by their caregivers (i.e., requiring social referencing), it is developmentally atypical for 41/2-year-old children to approach strangers affectionately, to touch, talk, or walk off with them, especially without referencing their caregivers. It is also maladaptive and potentially dangerous! Recognition of DSED is an important step in providing the sort of clinical care that can help this vulnerable cluster of patients whose lives have already been marked by inattention and neglect.",

         "Matthew J. Friedman, M.D., Ph.D.  Traumatic Event: Bethany Pinsky, age 23, had gone to a theater to see the local premiere of a big-budget movie. As she settled into her seat, waiting for the show to begin, a young man in a ski mask suddenly appeared in front of the screen. Brandishing an assault rifle, he fired directly into the audience. She saw many people get shot, including the woman sitting next to her. People all around began screaming, and there was a confused stampede for the exit door. Terrified, she somehow fought her way to the exit and escaped, uninjured, to the parking lot, where police cars were just arriving. Charles Quigley, age 25, went to the same movie theater at the same time. He too feared for his life. Hiding behind a row of seats, he was able to crawl to the aisle and sprint to the exit. Although covered in blood, he escaped without physical injury. Bethany and Charles, 2 Days Later: Two days later, both Ms. Pinsky and Mr. Quigley considered themselves \"nervous wrecks.\" Grateful that they were alive and uninjured, they nevertheless found themselves extremely anxious and on edge. They jumped at the slightest noise. They kept watching television for the latest information about the shooting, but every time there was actual videotaped footage of the event, they experienced panic attacks, broke out into a sweat, were unable to calm down, and could not stop thinking about the traumatic event. They could not sleep at night because of nightmares, and during the day they felt assaulted by intrusive and unwelcome memories of gunshots, screams, and their own personal terror during the event.  Bethany, 2 Weeks Later: Ms. Pinsky had reclaimed most of her pretraumatic thoughts, feelings, and behaviors within 2 weeks. Although traumatic reminders of the shooting sometimes led to a brief panic or physiological reaction, these did not dominate her waking hours. She no longer experienced nightmares. She knew that she would never forget what happened in that movie theater, but for the most part, her life was returning to normal and had returned to the trajectory it had been following before the shootings occurred. Charles, 2 Weeks Later: Mr. Quigley had not recovered 2 weeks later. He felt  emotionally constricted and unable to experience pleasant or positive feelings. He jumped at the slightest sound, he was unable to focus on his work, and his sleep was fitful and marked by traumatic nightmares. He tried to avoid any reminders of the shootings but nevertheless relentlessly recalled the sound of gunfire, the screams, and the sticky feel of the blood pouring out of his neighbor's chest and onto him as he hid behind the seats. He felt episodically disconnected from his surroundings and from himself. He viewed his life as having been changed by this traumatic experience.",
         "Discussion During the acute aftermath of a traumatic event, almost everyone is upset. The appropriate professional stance at this very early stage is that these are transient reactions that will typically resolve within 2-3 days and from which normal recovery should be expected. Ms. Pinsky's reaction after the shooting falls within the broad range of reactions called normative stress reactions in DSM-5. It is a normal response to traumatic stress and not a psychiatric disorder. Many different symptom presentations may occur in normative stress reactions, but they generally include a combination of the following: a. Emotional reactions, such as shock, fear, grief, anger, resentment, guilt, shame, helplessness, hopelessness, and numbing b. Cognitive reactions, such as confusion, disorientation, dissociation, indecisiveness, difficulty concentrating, memory loss, self-blame, and unwanted memories c. Physical reactions, such as tension, fatigue, insomnia, startle reactions, racing pulse, nausea, and loss of appetite d. Interpersonal reactions, such as distrust, irritability, withdrawal/isolation, feeling rejected/abandoned, and being distant A significant minority of individuals develop acute stress disorder (ASD), which involves more intense symptoms, during the month after the traumatic event. To meet DSM-5 criteria for ASD following a trauma, an individual must exhibit a minimum of nine of 14 possible symptoms, spread across five categories:  a. Intrusion symptoms, such as intrusive distressing memories, recurrent traumatic dreams, dissociative reliving (e.g., flashbacks) of the traumatic event, and intense psychological distress or physiological reactivity to traumatic reminders b. Negative mood, such as an inability to experience positive emotions  c. Dissociative symptoms, such as amnesia, and derealization or depersonalization  d. Avoidance symptoms, such as avoidance of internal reminders such as trauma- related thoughts or feelings and avoidance of external reminders such as people, places, or situations e. Arousal symptoms, such as insomnia, irritability, hypervigilance, problems of concentration, or exaggerated startle reactions Depending on which symptom categories are most prominent, patients with ASD can seem quite different from one another. For example, one person with ASD might have all of the intrusion symptoms, whereas another may have none of them. ASD is distinguished from other psychiatric diagnoses on the basis of a careful history. For example, ASD is diagnosed within the first month after a trauma, whereas posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can only be diagnosed after that first month. Adjustment disorders are also diagnosed in the first month following a trauma, but unlike ASD patients, patients with adjustment disorder do not have 9 of the 14 possible ASD symptoms. When symptoms are evaluated individually, the variety of ASD symptoms can mislead the clinician. Panic, anxiety, depression, dissociation, and intrusive, obsessional thoughts are all common in ASD, for example, and can lead to consideration of a wide spectrum of disorders. Traumatic brain injury often accompanies and complicates the diagnosis of both ASD and PTSD, especially when the brain injury is relatively subtle and unrecognized. Evaluation of any of these symptoms can be confusing, especially when the trauma is not as obvious as a movie theater shooting. Bringing together seemingly unrelated symptoms into one or two diagnoses can reduce patient confusion, focus treatment, and reduce unnecessary pharmacological treatment.",

         "Robert S. Pynoos, M.D., M.P.H. Alan M. Steinberg, Ph.D. Christopher M. Layne, Ph.D. Dylan, a 15-year-old high school student, was referred to a psychiatrist for help in dealing with stress from being involved in a serious automobile accident 2 weeks earlier. On the day of the accident, Dylan was riding in the front passenger seat when, as the car was pulling out of a driveway, it was struck by an oncoming SUV that was speeding through a yellow light. The car he was in was hit squarely on the driver's side, which caused the car to roll over once and come to rest right side up. The collision of metal on metal made an extremely loud noise. The driver of the car, a high school classmate, was knocked unconscious for a short period and was bleeding from a gash in his forehead. Upon seeing his injured friend, Dylan became afraid that his friend might be dead. His friend in the back seat of the car was frantically trying to unlatch her seat belt. Dylan's  door was jammed, and Dylan feared that their car might catch fire while he was stuck in it. After a few minutes, the driver, Dylan, and the other passenger were able to exit through the passenger doors and move away from the car. They realized that the driver of the SUV was unharmed and had already called the police. An ambulance was on its way. All three were transported to a local emergency room, where they were attended to and released to their parents' care after a few hours. Dylan had not had a good night's sleep since the accident. He often awoke in the middle of the night with his heart racing, visualizing oncoming headlights. He was having trouble concentrating and was unable to effectively complete his homework. His parents, who had begun to drive him to and from school, noticed that he was anxious every time they pulled out of a driveway or crossed an intersection. Although he had recently received his driving permit, he refused to practice driving with his father. He was also unusually short-tempered with his parents, his younger sisters, and his friends. He had recently gone to see a movie but had walked out of the theater before the movie started; he complained that the sound system was too loud. His concerned parents tried to talk to him about his stress, but he would irritably cut them off. After doing poorly on an important exam, however, he accepted the encouragement of a favorite teacher to go to a psychiatrist.  When seen, Dylan described additional difficulties. He hated that he was \"jumpy\" around loud noises, and he could not shake the image of his injured and unresponsive friend. He had waves of anger toward the driver of the SUV. He reported feeling embarrassed and disappointed in himself for being reluctant to practice driving. He stated that about 5 years earlier, he had witnessed the near-drowning of one of his younger sisters. Also, he mentioned that this past month was the first anniversary of his grandfather's death.",
         "Discussion Dylan meets the DSM-5 diagnostic formulation of acute stress disorder (ASD), which requires any 9 of 14 acute stress symptoms. ASD can be diagnosed 3 days after exposure to a traumatic situation; it may be a transient stress response that remits within 1 month or may progress after 1 month to PTSD.  Dylan presents with symptoms of ASD 2 weeks after being involved in a serious automobile accident. His symptoms are associated with clinically significant distress, impairment in social and school functioning, and disengagement from current developmental tasks (e.g., learning to drive). In adolescence, such acute disruption can have immediate and long-term consequences-providing the rationale for prompt diagnosis and intervention. Dylan's stress-related symptoms include recurrent intrusive distressing memories of the accident; psychological and physiological reactions to reminders; efforts to avoid thinking or having feelings about what happened; avoidance of external reminders that restricts his daily life; a recurrent distressing dream and an accompanying sleep disturbance that leaves him unrested and tired during the day; irritable behavior that disrupts his relationships with parents and friends; problems with concentration that jeopardize school performance during this important high school year; and an exaggerated startle response, which makes him feel childish and different from his friends. Although the driver lost consciousness, Dylan remained fully conscious and showed no signs of a mild traumatic brain injury. There was no persistent disorientation or confusion. Dylan also has no history of a prior anxiety disorder that would explain his symptoms, all of which began after the traumatic event.  Like many adolescents, Dylan is reluctant to discuss his experience or symptoms, in part because doing so makes him feel that something is wrong with him-a concern that adds to his adolescent anxiety over being different from peers. Acute intervention strategies can help adolescents to understand their acute stress reactions, gain skills to manage reminders, and develop plans with their teachers to gradually recover their prior level of academic functioning. Prior traumatic experiences and losses-such as his sister's near- drowning and his grandfather's death-can exacerbate an individual's reactions to a current trauma and can increase a clinician's understanding of the symptom profile.",

         "Lori L. Davis, M.D.  Eric Reynolds, a 75-year-old retired electrician, sought help at the Veterans Affairs outpatient mental health care clinic because of his \"very short fuse\" and tendency to be \"easily triggered.\" Mr. Reynolds indicated that he had had these symptoms for decades, but that he had finally agreed to get treated because his wife seemed desperate that he get in better control. Mr. Reynolds indicated that he always felt on guard, especially while in public. When unexpectedly startled by sudden noises, he tended to fly into a rage. That was apparently one reason he had chosen to be a self-employed electrician: he could work by himself. Similarly, he enjoyed hunting and gardening, activities that he could enjoy in quiet solitude. Reluctantly, he described intrusive memories of watching his fellow soldiers die in the field, which caused him enormous shame, guilt, and sadness, Several times a week, he awakes in a panicky sweat after a combat nightmare, although, as he said, \"It's ridiculous. Those guys have been dead for 50 years.\" Although these symptoms are very distressing, Mr. Reynolds is most worried about his \"hair-trigger\" temper. Without cause, he finds himself antagonizing other drivers who cut him off, confronting strangers who stand too close to him in checkout lines, and shifting into \"attack mode\" when approached from behind by others. He springs into this aggressive mode automatically, without a thought or consideration of the circumstances. Although he keeps a handgun in the console of his car for self-protection, Mr. Reynolds has no intention of harming others. He is always remorseful after a threatening incident and worries that he might inadvertently hurt someone. Most recently, while drifting off  to sleep on his physician's examination table, a nurse touched his foot, and he leapt up and began cursing in a threatening manner. He felt as if he were back on guard duty, when he was accidentally dozing, and an incoming mortar round stunned him into action. His reaction scared both the nurse and himself. Mr. Reynolds's symptoms apparently began soon after he left Vietnam, where he served as a field radio operator. He never sought help for his symptoms, apparently because of his independent and self-reliant nature. After retirement as a self-employed electrician, he spent almost all of his time at home. During these past few years, his wife and adult children became more aware of his various symptoms, including how they were putting a severe strain on his family relationships and overall happiness. Mr. Reynolds was raised in a loving family that struggled financially as Midwestern farmers. At age 20, Mr. Reynolds was drafted into the U.S. Army and deployed to Vietnam. He described himself as having been upbeat and happy prior to his army induction. He said he enjoyed basic training and his first few weeks in Vietnam, until one of his comrades got killed. At that point, all he cared about was getting home alive, even if it meant killing others. His personality changed from that of a happy-go-lucky farm boy to a terrified, overprotective soldier. Upon returning to civilian life, he managed to get a graduate business degree, but he became a self-employed electrician because of his need to stay isolated in his work. In his retirement, he hoped to volunteer, garden, and get some \"peace and quiet.\" It turned out, however, that his retirement was much like the rest of his adult life: although he could occasionally settle into one of his hobbies, most of his days were filled with tension, guilt, and arguments.  Despite having used alcohol and marijuana during his early adulthood, he had not consumed excessive alcohol for several decades or used marijuana since the age of 30. He had no legal history. On examination, Mr. Reynolds was a well-groomed man who appeared anxious and somewhat guarded. He was coherent and articulate. His speech was at a normal rate, but the pace accelerated when he discussed disturbing content. He denied depression but was anxious. His affect was somewhat constricted but appropriate to content. His thought process was coherent and linear. He denied all suicidal and homicidal ideation.  He had no psychotic symptoms, delusions, or hallucinations. He had very good insight. He was well oriented and seemed to have above-average intelligence.",
         "Discussion Mr. Reynolds manifests symptoms from all four PTSD symptom categories: intrusive symptoms, persistent avoidance, negative alterations in cognitions and mood associated with the traumatic event, and marked alterations in arousal and reactivity. Mr. Reynolds's primary concerns relate to fear-mediated symptoms, particularly his exaggerated fight-or-flight responses to unexpected stimulation. As is often seen in PTSD, the reaction is out of proportion to the circumstances and can be unpredictable; in other words, the reaction is not premeditated or part of general impulsivity. In addition to hyperreactivity, Mr. Reynolds demonstrates hypervigilance, excessive concern for safety, and anxiety or fear. He has classic reexperiencing symptoms of intrusive memories, nightmares, flashbacks, and physiological reactivity to triggers that resemble or remind him of the traumatic events. Although not present in this patient, suicidality and psychotic symptoms are not uncommon in PTSD and should be evaluated on a regular basis.  As is often the case with PTSD, Mr. Reynolds exhibits a powerful, involuntary reaction to particular kinds of external stimuli. These symptoms of being \"easily triggered\" are very disturbing for the individual as well as for family members, friends, and caregivers. Mr. Reynolds's efforts to avoid conflict have progressively narrowed his opportunities in all spheres, including social, family, and hobbies. For example, his decision to work as an electrician rather than to take advantage of his business degree seems based largely on his effort to control his personal space. It would be useful to know more about how Mr. Reynolds's PTSD might be affecting his relationship with his wife. His retirement appears to have worsened his symptoms and propelled him into finally seeking treatment. One possibility is that his wife is now spending more time with him and able to see his reactions more frequently and serves as a force behind his decision to seek treatment. Another possibility is that his retirement was precipitated by the negative consequences of untreated PTSD symptoms on his job-related duties and relationships. Because people with PTSD have high rates of psychiatric comorbidity, the practitioner  should carefully consider other diagnoses. Mr. Reynolds has apparently not consumed excessive alcohol or marijuana in many years, so neither appears related to the exacerbation of his symptoms; however, because substance use is very common in patients with PTSD, special attention should be paid to the possibility of underreporting. Mr. Reynolds's edgy hyperarousal overlaps somewhat with the dysphoric irritability that can be seen in bipolar II disorder, but his most intense symptoms are reactive and sudden; this contrasts with the multiday periods of manic symptoms such as mood changes, racing thoughts, elevated energy or drive, or a reduced need for sleep. He denies feeling depressed, and his reduced pleasure appears more related to his avoidance of social activities that he previously found enjoyable. He has maintained interest in woodworking and reading, which are consistent with his tendency to self- isolate in a safe and quiet environment. Like many survivors of trauma, Mr. Reynolds prides himself on his resiliency and independence; such qualities likely served him well in Vietnam and while running his business. That same independence seems to have contributed to his avoidance of mental health treatment despite 50 years of uncomfortable symptoms. It would be useful to further explore his thoughts about stigma, psychotherapy, and PTSD, given that the development of a trusting alliance will be crucial to his treatment.",

         "This case is dedicated to the memory of James S. Jackson, Ph.D., in recognition of his leadership of research on the mental health of Black Americans. Cheryl C. Munday, Ph.D. Jamie Miller Abelson, M.S.W. Franklin Sims was a 21-year-old single African American man who sought treatment at a university-affiliated community mental health care clinic because he felt \"stressed out,\" withdrawn from friends, and \"worried about money.\" He said he had been feeling depressed for 3 months, and he attributed the \"nosedive\" to the end of a 3-year romantic relationship shortly after he and his girlfriend had seriously discussed marriage. Mr. Sims, the son of working-class parents, had supported himself financially since high school and was accustomed to feeling nervous about making ends meet. He was angered by his girlfriend's decision to end the relationship, particularly her failure to understand his concerns about establishing financial stability. He increasingly ruminated about money, his grades, and his future. Mr. Sims was a full-time undergraduate employed as a full-time midnight-shift warehouse worker. He was accustomed to this schedule, but he had increasingly found it difficult to concentrate in class after staying awake all night at the warehouse. When he had a day off, his sleep and energy were fine, and he still enjoyed hanging out with his friends. His appetite was unchanged, and his physical health was good. His grades had recently declined, however, and he had become increasingly discouraged about money and about being his family's first college student. His parents did not understand why he had decided to attend an out-of-state university, and he was increasingly dissatisfied with life on the predominantly white college campus after some recent experiences of racial discrimination. He had not previously sought any type of mental health care services, but a supportive cousin suggested that he see a therapist after he had told her that he sometimes just felt like giving up.  Mr. Sims was an only child-a self-described \"good student and popular kid.\" High school was complicated by his parents' periodic unemployment, financial strains, and related marital difficulties. He started drinking alcohol and smoking marijuana in ninth grade, but neither had ever caused him difficulty. At the time of the evaluation, he said he occasionally had a beer or marijuana cigarette at parties, but that he didn't have the time, money, or inclination to get intoxicated. On examination, Mr. Sims was punctual, cooperative, pleasant, attentive, appropriately dressed, and well groomed. He spoke coherently. He appeared generally worried and constricted, but he smiled appropriately several times during the interview. He said he felt bad about his declining grades, but he denied feeling guilty or worthless. He had a quiet, dry sense of humor. He denied current suicidality, homicidality, and psychosis. He was cognitively intact, and his insight and judgment were considered good.",
         "Discussion The case report indicates that Mr. Sims has felt depressed, angry, withdrawn, and episodically hopeless over the past few months. These problems appear to have developed in response to the breakup with his girlfriend. It would be useful to further explore his recent history, including whether the hopelessness shaded into suicidality, but it appears that his appetite, sleep, and energy are normal. He has had difficulty concentrating and feeling rested, but his schedule would make it difficult not to be sleep deprived, and he appears to rebound quickly when he does get the occasional day off. Although he would not meet DSM-5 criteria for major depressive disorder, he does appear to be suffering and having difficulty functioning. Substance use and medical issues do not appear to be implicated. He appears, therefore, to meet criteria for adjustment disorder with depressed mood. In addition to learning more about the breakup, it would be important to further explore Mr. Sims's adjustment to a predominantly white university, including the stress of racial discrimination and the likelihood that his parents may not appreciate the difficulties of his situation. It would also be useful to clarify his sleep issues, his depressive and anxiety symptoms, and stress related to family conflict and financial insecurity.  In the course of the evaluation, it would also be helpful to underline his many strengths. For example, until recently he has been able to successfully negotiate a full-time job, a serious relationship, and a full-time academic schedule at a university far from home. Clarifying his resilience is useful both for developing a treatment plan and for reminding Mr. Sims that the evaluator sees him as a young person of promise as well as someone who could use help with his mental health. It bodes well for his long-term adjustment that Mr. Sims appears motivated for treatment. Young Black men are generally expected to be strong and independent, and norms of masculinity make it difficult for them to seek help or talk about their feelings. For Mr. Sims, coming to the counseling center would not have been an easy step to take. The success of Mr. Sims's eventual treatment is likely based at least partly on his alliance with a therapist who is comfortable with issues specific to Mr. Sims's gender, race, and ethnicity. For example, Mr. Sims is an academic striver with considerable desire for personal growth, but it would not be surprising if he maintained an ambivalent perspective on his achievement orientation. As a first-generation college student, his parents' emotional support may be compromised by their limited familiarity with higher educational demands. In his culture, studying hard can be seen as a \"white\" endeavor, and complaining of psychological distress can be seen as a sign of masculine weakness.  As a young man striving to maintain financial independence and to consolidate masculine social roles, increased recognition of everyday racial discrimination may exacerbate the stressful impact of his girlfriend's rejection. Diagnostically, an adjustment disorder reflects an immediate stress response and may portend a more long-term, more severe psychological outcome. Therapeutically, it would be important to address the personal meaning of his loss and the potential chronicity of everyday racial discrimination as he attempts to consolidate a gender role that is consistent with peer culture, racial group identity, and racial and cultural norms. Seeking therapy could therefore be perceived by him both as a further blow to his sense of emotional resilience and as an important source of support in adjusting to the loss of his girlfriend. Therapeutic support of his long-term future goals could prove to be a protective factor against the long-term impact of persistent racial discrimination and of future psychological distress.",

         "Anna Dickerman, M.D. John W. Barnhill, M.D. The psychiatric consultation-liaison service at a large hospital was asked to \"rule out depression\" in Gabriela Trentino, a 65-year-old woman with recurrent lung cancer, after she was noted to display sad affect and tearfulness on morning rounds. Ms. Trentino was a widowed Italian American homemaker with two grown sons. She had just been admitted to the medical service for shortness of breath. She was subsequently found to have a unilateral pleural effusion. Ms. Trentino had already been through several rounds of chemotherapy over the prior few months. At the time of the  consultation, she was awaiting the results of thoracentesis to assess for pulmonary metastases. Interviewed separately, Ms. Trentino and her two sons agreed that until this hospitalization, she had never previously been especially depressed or anxious but had instead been the family's \"rock.\" She had never seen a therapist, taken psychiatric medication, or used alcohol, opiates, or illicit drugs. Her family history was notable for a father who drank to excess, which she described as the reason she had never tasted alcohol. On examination, the patient was a well-groomed woman sitting in bed with an oxygen nasal cannula in place, wringing her hands and dabbing at her eyes with a wet tissue. She was cooperative and coherent. She was visibly dysphoric, with a constricted, worried affect. She reported being extremely worried about the pending thoracentesis study. She knew that metastases could mean \"a death sentence\" and said, \"I want to be alive for my son's marriage this year.\" She added tearfully, \"I've been through so much with the illness already. . . . When is it going to stop?\" Ms. Trentino endorsed poor sleep and impaired concentration since her admission to the hospital 5 days earlier. She had been eating less than usual. She said she was \"too sad and worried\" to do her usual daily crossword. She denied confusion and psychotic symptoms. She appeared cognitively intact, and her Montreal Cognitive Assessment score was 29 out of 30, with 1 lost point for incorrect recall of an object after 5 minutes. She adamantly denied suicidal ideation, again speaking of her love for her two children.  Ms. Trentino's vital signs were notable for an oxygen saturation of 94% on room air (corrected to 99% on nasal cannula), and her chest X ray showed a large left-sided pleural effusion. Neurological examination was unremarkable. Her basic lab results were otherwise within normal limits. Collateral information from nursing staff indicated that she rang her call bell frequently throughout the day to ask about medication and test details.",
         "Discussion with the patient's family members revealed appropriate concern about their mother's health, as well as frustration over her psychological state. As one of the sons told the psychiatric consultant, \"We understand this is a stressful time for Mom, but all  she does in the hospital is cry all day and keep on asking us the same questions over and over again. She's usually the pillar of the family, and now she's needy and pessimistic. Can you do something?\"  Discussion Ms. Trentino presents with depressive and anxious symptoms in clear temporal relation to a major stressor (rehospitalization for malignancy with the possibility of progression of disease). The patient, her family, and the hospital staff indicate that her presentation is clinically significant, affecting both her and her care. The most likely DSM-5 diagnosis is adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood. In addition to adjustment disorder, several other diagnoses are also possible. Her medical team is concerned that she has a depression. Ms. Trentino does endorse four major depressive signs and symptoms (depressed mood most of the day, decreased appetite, insomnia, and poor concentration), and these are affecting her quality of life. To meet DSM-5 criteria for major depressive disorder, however, one must have five depressive symptoms for 2 weeks, and Ms. Trentino has had only four symptoms for less than 1 week. If Ms. Trentino's symptoms intensify slightly and persist, she would likely qualify for a major depressive disorder diagnosis. Ms. Trentino also displays significant anxiety. She describes difficulty concentrating, feelings of being on edge, and poor sleep. By report, Ms. Trentino never had significant anxiety until she was faced with the recent potentially life-threatening illness. The acuity makes an underlying anxiety disorder unlikely. Brain metastases and paraneoplastic syndrome are not unusual in lung cancer and could cause anxiety and depression. Neither of these devastating complications tends to occur, however, without other neurological abnormalities and delirium. In consultation with neurology and oncology, a brain scan and/or paraneoplastic panel might be warranted. Ms. Trentino's hypoxemia-presumably secondary to her pleural effusion-may have contributed to her anxiety. The anxiety has persisted after correction of her oxygen saturation, but dysregulated oxygenation can often cause anxiety. Medications can also cause anxiety and depression. Although the team should look  throughout the medications list, the search should focus particularly on the use of and withdrawal from steroids, opiates, and benzodiazepines. Adjustment disorder was reclassified in DSM-5 into the chapter on trauma- and stressor-related disorders. Life-threatening illness is an example of such a stressor. For Ms. Trentino to warrant a diagnosis of acute stress disorder, her symptoms would need to intensify. A posttraumatic stress disorder diagnosis would require both an intensification of symptoms and a duration of greater than 1 month. If Ms. Trentino's worries interfere with her treatment, she might qualify for an additional DSM-5 diagnosis: psychological factors affecting other medical conditions. At the moment, however, she has been compliant with treatments and interventions.",
