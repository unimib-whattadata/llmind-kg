In addition to daily periods of irrepressible need to sleep or daytime lapses into sleep, type 1 narcolepsy is characterised by symptoms of REM sleep dissociation, most importantly cataplexy. Cataplexy is a sudden and uncontrollable loss of muscle tone arising during wakefulness that is typically triggered by a strong emotion, such as excitement or laughter. Although cataplexy is a pathognomonic symptom of type 1 narcolepsy, it may not manifest until years following onset of the sleepiness. In such cases, a diagnosis of narcolepsy, type 1 may be made based on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-hypocretin levels < 110 picograms per milliliter. Episodes of sleep paralysis and hypnagogic or hypnopompic hallucinations may also be present. The disorder is not attributable to a disease of the nervous system or other medical condition.

Note: A definitive diagnosis requires daily periods of irrepressible need to sleep or daytime lapses into sleep plus either: a) cataplexy and multiple sleep latency test/polysomnography (MSLT/PSG) findings characteristic of narcolepsy; or b) demonstrated CSF hypocretin deficiency.""" ;

It is characterised by persistent and frequent or pervasive disruption of the rhythmic flow of speech (stutter-typical symptoms, core symptoms) and by frequently occurring accompanying symptoms such as speech-related anxieties and by avoidance of speech situations. It significantly affects communication. Stutter-typical symptoms are repetitions of sounds, syllables or monosyllabic words, prolongations, word breaks, audible or silent blockage of speech production, insertions of sounds and syllables, or excessive use of interjections. Accompanying symptoms are strategies to control, escape or avoid disfluencies, for example by muscle tension, breath irregularities, co-movements of mimic muscles, head, or limbs." ;

Mood and behaviour abnormalities, sometimes severe, are often present. Developmental delay or autistic features may be present, but many patients are cognitively normal.

    skos:definition """Sleep related hypoxemia due to a medical condition is characterised by sustained declines in SpO2 (oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximeter) (≤ 88% in adults or ≤ 90% in children for ≥ 5 minutes) during sleep. The condition is attributable to a medical or neurological disorder. The presence of hypoxemia is not better explained by another sleep related breathing disorder (e.g., obstructive sleep apnoea). Although some amount of obstructive or central apnoea may be present, these disorders are not thought to be primarily responsible for the hypoxemia during sleep. Some patients with sleep related hypoxemia also exhibit hypoxemia during wakefulness. If the presence of hypercapnia has been established, a diagnosis of sleep-related hypoventilation should be made, rather than sleep-related hypoxemia.

Note: A definitive diagnosis requires objective evidence based on polysomnographic monitoring of oxygen saturation in arterial blood (SaO2) in the presence of a medical condition that is judged to be causing the declines in SaO2.""" ;

Chronic hypoventilation during sleep exists without any readily identifiable impairments of respiration, such as pulmonary airway or parenchymal conditions, neurologic, neuromuscular or chest wall abnormalities, severe obesity, other sleep related breathing disorder, or use of respiratory depressant medications or substances. Diurnal as well as nocturnal hypoventilation is believed to be due primarily to blunted chemoresponsiveness to carbon dioxide (CO2) and oxygen (O2). Patients may complain of morning headaches, fatigue, neurocognitive decline and sleep disturbance, or may be entirely asymptomatic.

Note: A definitive diagnosis requires objective evidence based on polysomnography with carbon dioxide (CO2) monitoring (by arterial, end-tidal or transcutaneous measures).""" ;

    skos:definition "Partial dissociative identity disorder is characterised by disruption of identity in which there are two or more distinct personality states (dissociative identities) associated with marked discontinuities in the sense of self and agency. Each personality state includes its own pattern of experiencing, perceiving, conceiving, and relating to self, the body, and the environment. One personality state is dominant and normally functions in daily life, but is intruded upon by one or more non-dominant personality states (dissociative intrusions). These intrusions may be cognitive, affective, perceptual, motor, or behavioural. They are experienced as interfering with the functioning of the dominant personality state and are typically aversive. The non-dominant personality states do not recurrently take executive control of the individual’s consciousness and functioning, but there may be occasional, limited and transient episodes in which a distinct personality state assumes executive control to engage in circumscribed behaviours, such as in response to extreme emotional states or during episodes of self-harm or the reenactment of traumatic memories. The symptoms are not better explained by another mental, behavioural or neurodevelopmental disorder and are not due to the direct effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous system, including withdrawal effects, and are not due to a disease of the nervous system or a sleep-wake disorder. The symptoms result in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning." ;

Gaming disorder, predominantly online is characterised by a pattern of persistent or recurrent gaming behaviour (‘digital gaming’ or ‘video-gaming’) that is primarily conducted over the internet and is manifested by: 

1. impaired control over gaming (e.g., onset, frequency, intensity, duration, termination, context); 
2. increasing priority given to gaming to the extent that gaming takes precedence over other life interests and daily activities; and 
3. continuation or escalation of gaming despite the occurrence of negative consequences. The behaviour pattern is of sufficient severity to result in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning. 

The pattern of gaming behaviour may be continuous or episodic and recurrent. The gaming behaviour and other features are normally evident over a period of at least 12 months in order for a diagnosis to be assigned, although the required duration may be shortened if all diagnostic requirements are met and symptoms are severe."""^^xsd:string ;

Hyperactivity refers to excessive motor activity and difficulties with remaining still, most evident in structured situations that require behavioural self-control. Impulsivity is a tendency to act in response to immediate stimuli, without deliberation or consideration of the risks and consequences.

Presenting features may include anxiety, anger, impaired attention, hypervigilance, psychomotor agitation, paranoid ideation (possibly of delusional intensity), transient auditory hallucinations, transitory confusion, and changes in sociability. Perspiration or chills, nausea or vomiting, and palpitations may be experienced. Physical signs may include tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, pupillary dilatation, dyskinesias and dystonias, and skin sores. In rare instances, usually in severe intoxication, use of stimulants including amphetamines, methamphetamine and methcathinone can result in seizures."^^xsd:string ;

Coordinated motor skills difficulties cause significant and persistent limitations in functioning (e.g. in activities of daily living, school work, and vocational and leisure activities).

There are a wide variety of alcoholic drinks, with alcohol concentrations typically ranging from 1.5% to 60%. Alcohol is predominantly a central nervous system depressant. In addition to ability to produce Alcohol Intoxication, alcohol has dependence-producing properties, resulting in Alcohol Dependence in some people and Alcohol Withdrawal when alcohol use is reduced or discontinued. Unlike most other substances, elimination of alcohol from the body occurs at a constant rate, such that its clearance follows a linear rather than a logarithmic course. Alcohol is implicated in a wide range of harms affecting most organs and systems of the body (e.g., cirrhosis of the liver, gastrointestinal cancers, pancreatitis). Harm to others resulting from behaviour during Alcohol Intoxication is well recognized and is included in the definitions of harmful use of alcohol (i.e., Episode of Harmful Use of Alcohol and Harmful Pattern of Use of Alcohol).

The opioids all have analgesic properties of different potencies and are primarily central nervous system depressants. They suppress respiration as well as other vital functions and are a common cause of overdose and related deaths. Certain opioids are used or administered parenterally, including heroin, a common and potent opioid that is primarily used non-medically. Therapeutic opioids are prescribed for a range of indications worldwide, and are essential for pain management in cancer pain and palliative care, although they are also used for non-therapeutic reasons.
