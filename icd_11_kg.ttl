The pattern of eating behaviour is not motivated by preoccupation with body weight or shape. Restricted food intake and its effects on weight, other aspects of health, or functioning are not due to unavailability of food, not a manifestation of another medical condition (e.g. food allergies, hyperthyroidism) or mental disorder, and are not due to the effect of a substance or medication on the central nervous system including withdrawal effects." ;

The desire to become physically disabled results in harmful consequences, as manifested by either the preoccupation with the desire (including time spent pretending to be disabled) significantly interfering with productivity, with leisure activities, or with social functioning (e.g. person is unwilling to have a close relationship because it would make it difficult to pretend) or by attempts to actually become disabled having resulted in the person putting his or her health or life in significant jeopardy. The disturbance is not better accounted for by another mental, behavioural or neurodevelopmental disorder, by a Disease of the Nervous System or by another medical condition, or by Malingering." ;

These disturbances are caused by the known pharmacological effects of caffeine and their intensity is closely related to the amount of caffeine consumed. They are time-limited and abate as caffeine is cleared from the body. Presenting features may include restlessness, anxiety, excitement, insomnia, flushed face, tachycardia, diuresis, gastrointestinal disturbances, muscle twitching, psychomotor agitation, perspiration or chills, and nausea or vomiting. Cardiac arrhythmias may occur. Disturbances typical of intoxication tend to occur at relatively higher doses (e.g., > 1 g per day). Very high doses of caffeine (e.g., > 5 g) can result in respiratory distress or seizures and can be fatal." ;

These disturbances are caused by the known pharmacological effects of cannabis and their intensity is closely related to the amount of cannabis consumed. They are time-limited and abate as cannabis is cleared from the body. Presenting features may include inappropriate euphoria, impaired attention, impaired judgment, perceptual alterations (such as the sensation of floating, altered perception of time), changes in sociability, increased appetite, anxiety, intensification of ordinary experiences, impaired short-term memory, and sluggishness. Physical signs include conjunctival injection (red or bloodshot eyes) and tachycardia." ;

The sleep disturbance and associated daytime symptoms occur at least several times per week for at least 3 months. Some individuals with chronic insomnia may show a more episodic course, with recurrent episodes of sleep/wake difficulties lasting several weeks at a time over several years. Individuals who report sleep related symptoms in the absence of daytime impairment are not regarded as having an insomnia disorder.

    skos:definition "Cocaine-induced impulse control disorder is characterised by persistently repeated behaviours in which there is recurrent failure to resist an impulse, drive, or urge to perform an act that is rewarding to the person, at least in the short-term, despite longer-term harm either to the individual or to others (e.g., fire setting or stealing without apparent motive, repetitive sexual behaviour, aggressive outbursts) that develop during or soon after intoxication with or withdrawal from cocaine. The intensity or duration of the symptoms is substantially in excess of disturbances of impulse control that are characteristic of Cocaine intoxication or Cocaine withdrawal. The amount and duration of cocaine use must be capable of producing disturbances of impulse control. The symptoms are not better explained by a primary mental disorder (e.g., an Impulse control disorder, a Disorder due to addictive behaviours), as might be the case if the impulse control disturbances preceded the onset of the cocaine use, if the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time after cessation of the cocaine use or withdrawal, or if there is other evidence of a pre-existing primary mental disorder with impulse control symptoms (e.g., a history of prior episodes not associated with cocaine use)." ;

Symptoms may include repetitive sexual activities becoming a central focus of the person’s life to the point of neglecting health and personal care or other interests, activities and responsibilities; numerous unsuccessful efforts to significantly reduce repetitive sexual behaviour; and continued repetitive sexual behaviour despite adverse consequences or deriving little or no satisfaction from it. The pattern of failure to control intense, sexual impulses or urges and resulting repetitive sexual behaviour is manifested over an extended period of time (e.g., 6 months or more), and causes marked distress or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Distress that is entirely related to moral judgments and disapproval about sexual impulses, urges, or behaviours is not sufficient to meet this requirement." ;

    skos:definition "Dissociative identity disorder is characterised by disruption of identity in which there are two or more distinct personality states (dissociative identities) associated with marked discontinuities in the sense of self and agency. Each personality state includes its own pattern of experiencing, perceiving, conceiving, and relating to self, the body, and the environment. At least two distinct personality states recurrently take executive control of the individual’s consciousness and functioning in interacting with others or with the environment, such as in the performance of specific aspects of daily life such as parenting, or work, or in response to specific situations (e.g., those that are perceived as threatening). Changes in personality state are accompanied by related alterations in sensation, perception, affect, cognition, memory, motor control, and behaviour. There are typically episodes of amnesia, which may be severe. The symptoms are not better explained by another mental, behavioural or neurodevelopmental disorder and are not due to the direct effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous system, including withdrawal effects, and are not due to a disease of the nervous system or a sleep-wake disorder. The symptoms result in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning." ;

The symptoms result in significant distress or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

They are time-limited and abate as the hallucinogen is cleared from the body.

Residual sleepiness in patients with adequately-treated obstructive sleep apnoea is classified here under the assumption that it is due to central nervous system damage from recurrent hypoxemia.

Diurnal as well as nocturnal hypoventilation is believed to be due primarily to blunted chemoresponsiveness to carbon dioxide (CO2) and oxygen (O2). Patients may complain of morning headaches, fatigue, neurocognitive decline and sleep disturbance, or may be entirely asymptomatic.

The daytime sleepiness is not better explained by another disorder (e.g., insufficient sleep syndrome, obstructive sleep apnoea, circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder), a substance or medication, or a medical condition). Objective evidence of hypersomnolence is indicated by an MSLT showing a mean sleep latency of ≤ 8 minutes or by polysomnography or wrist actigraphy showing a total 24-hour sleep time of 11 hours or more. Prolonged and severe sleep inertia is often observed and consists of sustained difficulty waking up with repeated returns to sleep, irritability, automatic behaviour, and confusion. In contrast to narcolepsy, naps are generally long, often more than 60 minutes, and unrefreshing.

A typical episode lasts a median of 10 days (range 2.5–80 days), with rare episodes lasting several weeks to months. During episodes, patients may sleep as long as 16 to 20 hours per day, waking or getting up only to eat and void. When awake during episodes, most patients are exhausted, apathetic, confused, and slow in speaking and answering. Hyperphagia, hypersexuality, childish behaviour, depression, anxiety, hallucinations and delusions are often observed during the episodes. Patients are normal between episodes with regard to sleep, cognition, mood, and eating. Rarely, Kleine Levin syndrome may occur exclusively during menstrual periods." ;

    skos:definition "MDMA or related drug intoxication, including MDA is a clinically significant transient condition that develops during or shortly after the consumption of MDMA or related drugs that is characterised by disturbances in consciousness, cognition, perception, affect, behaviour, or coordination. These disturbances are caused by the known pharmacological effects of MDMA or related drugs and their intensity is closely related to the amount of MDMA or a related drug consumed. They are time-limited and abate as MDMA or a related drug is cleared from the body. Presenting features may include increased or inappropriate sexual interest and activity, anxiety, restlessness, agitation, and sweating. In rare instances, usually in severe intoxication, use of MDMA or related drugs, including MDA can result in dystonia and seizures. Sudden death is a rare but recognised complication." ;

In addition to daily periods of irrepressible need to sleep or daytime lapses into sleep, type 1 narcolepsy is characterised by symptoms of REM sleep dissociation, most importantly cataplexy. Cataplexy is a sudden and uncontrollable loss of muscle tone arising during wakefulness that is typically triggered by a strong emotion, such as excitement or laughter. Although cataplexy is a pathognomonic symptom of type 1 narcolepsy, it may not manifest until years following onset of the sleepiness. In such cases, a diagnosis of narcolepsy, type 1 may be made based on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-hypocretin levels < 110 picograms per milliliter. Episodes of sleep paralysis and hypnagogic or hypnopompic hallucinations may also be present. The disorder is not attributable to a disease of the nervous system or other medical condition.

Note: A definitive diagnosis requires daily periods of irrepressible need to sleep or daytime lapses into sleep plus either: a) cataplexy and multiple sleep latency test/polysomnography (MSLT/PSG) findings characteristic of narcolepsy; or b) demonstrated CSF hypocretin deficiency.""" ;

These disturbances are caused by the known pharmacological effects of nicotine and their intensity is closely related to the amount of nicotine consumed. They are time-limited and abate as nicotine is cleared from the body. Presenting features may include restlessness, psychomotor agitation, anxiety, cold sweats, headache, insomnia, palpitations, paresthesias, nausea or vomiting, abdominal cramps, confusion, bizarre dreams, burning sensations in the mouth, and salivation. In rare instances, paranoid ideation, perceptual disturbances, convulsions or coma may occur.

Mood and behaviour abnormalities, sometimes severe, are often present. Developmental delay or autistic features may be present, but many patients are cognitively normal.

    skos:definition "Partial dissociative identity disorder is characterised by disruption of identity in which there are two or more distinct personality states (dissociative identities) associated with marked discontinuities in the sense of self and agency. Each personality state includes its own pattern of experiencing, perceiving, conceiving, and relating to self, the body, and the environment. One personality state is dominant and normally functions in daily life, but is intruded upon by one or more non-dominant personality states (dissociative intrusions). These intrusions may be cognitive, affective, perceptual, motor, or behavioural. They are experienced as interfering with the functioning of the dominant personality state and are typically aversive. The non-dominant personality states do not recurrently take executive control of the individual’s consciousness and functioning, but there may be occasional, limited and transient episodes in which a distinct personality state assumes executive control to engage in circumscribed behaviours, such as in response to extreme emotional states or during episodes of self-harm or the reenactment of traumatic memories. The symptoms are not better explained by another mental, behavioural or neurodevelopmental disorder and are not due to the direct effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous system, including withdrawal effects, and are not due to a disease of the nervous system or a sleep-wake disorder. The symptoms result in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning." ;

Specifically, when periodic limb movements are associated with Restless legs syndrome, narcolepsy or REM sleep behaviour disorder, a separate diagnosis of Periodic limb movement disorder is not warranted because the limb movements during sleep are considered an expected part of these disorders. Periodic limb movements occur most frequently in the lower extremities but may be seen in the arms as well. They may be associated with recurrent arousal from sleep, which gives rise to sleep disruption. The symptoms are sufficiently severe to result in significant distress or impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning (e.g., due to frequent disruptions in sleep.

    skos:definition "Prolonged grief disorder is a disturbance in which, following the death of a partner, parent, child, or other person close to the bereaved, there is persistent and pervasive grief response characterised by longing for the deceased or persistent preoccupation with the deceased accompanied by intense emotional pain (e.g. sadness, guilt, anger, denial, blame, difficulty accepting the death, feeling one has lost a part of one’s self, an inability to experience positive mood, emotional numbness, difficulty in engaging with social or other activities). The grief response has persisted for an atypically long period of time following the loss (more than 6 months at a minimum) and clearly exceeds expected social, cultural or religious norms for the individual’s culture and context. Grief reactions that have persisted for longer periods that are within a normative period of grieving given the person’s cultural and religious context are viewed as normal bereavement responses and are not assigned a diagnosis. The disturbance causes significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning." ;

The symptoms of Restless legs syndrome are worse at rest, alleviated with movement, and predominant in the evening or night. The symptoms are sufficiently severe to result in significant distress or impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning (e.g., due to frequent disruptions in sleep).

Retrograde Ejaculation most commonly occurs as a complication of transurethral prostatic resection, but may also be caused by other surgery of the pelvic area, nervous system dysfunction, or use of pharmacological agents. Confirmation is by identification of spermatozoa in a urine sample." ;

Daytime symptoms typically include fatigue, depressed mood or irritability, general malaise, and cognitive impairment. Individuals who report sleep related symptoms in the absence of daytime impairment are not regarded as having an insomnia disorder. If the insomnia is due to another sleep-wake disorder, a mental disorder, another medical condition, or a substance or medication, short-term insomnia should only be diagnosed if the insomnia is an independent focus of clinical attention." ;

These disturbances are caused by the known pharmacological effects of synthetic cannabinoids and their intensity is closely related to the amount of synthetic cannabinoid consumed. They are time-limited and abate as synthetic cannabinoid is cleared from the body. Presenting features may include inappropriate euphoria, impaired attention, impaired judgment, perceptual alterations (such as the sensation of floating, altered perception of time), changes in sociability, increased appetite, anxiety, intensification of ordinary experiences, impaired short-term memory, and sluggishness. Physical signs include conjunctival injection (red or bloodshot eyes) and tachycardia. Intoxication with synthetic cannabinoids may also cause delirium or acute psychosis." ;

    skos:definition "Synthetic cannabinoid-induced psychotic disorder is characterised by psychotic symptoms (e.g., delusions, hallucinations, disorganised thinking, grossly disorganised behaviour) that develop during or soon after intoxication with or withdrawal from synthetic cannabinoids. The intensity or duration of the symptoms is substantially in excess of psychotic-like disturbances of perception, cognition, or behaviour that are characteristic of Synthetic cannabinoid intoxication or Synthetic cannabinoid withdrawal. The amount and duration of synthetic cannabinoid use must be capable of producing psychotic symptoms. The symptoms are not better explained by a primary mental disorder (e.g., Schizophrenia, a Mood disorder with psychotic symptoms), as might be the case if the psychotic symptoms preceded the onset of the synthetic cannabinoid use, if the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time after cessation of the synthetic cannabinoid use or withdrawal, or if there is other evidence of a pre-existing primary mental disorder with psychotic symptoms (e.g., a history of prior episodes not associated with synthetic cannabinoid use)." ;

These disturbances are caused by the known pharmacological effects of synthetic cathinones and their intensity is closely related to the amount of synthetic cathinones consumed. They are time-limited and abate as the synthetic cathinone is cleared from the body. Presenting features may include anxiety, anger, impaired attention, hypervigilance, psychomotor agitation, paranoid ideation (possibly of delusional intensity), transient auditory hallucinations, transitory confusion, and changes in sociability. Perspiration or chills, nausea or vomiting, and palpitations may be experienced. Physical signs may include tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, pupillary dilatation, dyskinesias and dystonias, and skin sores. In rare instances, usually in severe intoxication, use of synthetic cathinones can result in seizures." ;

The trance state is not characterised by the experience of being replaced by an alternate identity. Trance episodes are recurrent or, if the diagnosis is based on a single episode, the episode has lasted for at least several days. The trance state is involuntary and unwanted and is not accepted as a part of a collective cultural or religious practice. The symptoms do not occur exclusively during another dissociative disorder and are not better explained by another mental, behavioural or neurodevelopmental disorder. The symptoms are not due to the direct effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous system, including withdrawal effects, exhaustion, or to hypnagogic or hypnopompic states, and are not due to a disease of the nervous system, head trauma, or a sleep-wake disorder.

These disturbances are caused by the known pharmacological effects of volatile inhalants and their intensity is closely related to the amount of volatile inhalant consumed. They are time-limited and abate as the volatile inhalant is cleared from the body. Presenting features may include euphoria, impaired judgment, aggression, somnolence, stupor or coma, dizziness, tremor, lack of coordination, slurred speech, unsteady gait, lethargy and apathy, psychomotor retardation, and visual disturbances. Muscle weakness and diplopia may occur. Use of volatile inhalants may cause cardiac arrhythmia, cardiac arrest, and death. Inhalants containing lead (e.g. some forms of petrol/gasoline) may cause confusion, irritability, coma and seizures." ;

The amount and duration of caffeine use must be capable of producing anxiety symptoms. The symptoms are not better explained by a primary mental disorder (e.g., an Anxiety and fear-related disorder, a Depressive disorder with prominent anxiety symptoms), as might be the case if the anxiety symptoms preceded the onset of the caffeine use, if the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time after cessation of the caffeine use or withdrawal, or if there is other evidence of a pre-existing primary mental disorder with anxiety symptoms (e.g., a history of prior episodes not associated with caffeine use)." ;

The longer cycle length (> 40 seconds) distinguishes central sleep apnoea with Cheyne-Stokes breathing from other central sleep apnoea types.

The intensity or duration of the symptoms is substantially in excess of analogous disturbances that are characteristic of Cocaine intoxication or Cocaine withdrawal. The amount and duration of cocaine use must be capable of producing obsessive-compulsive or related symptoms. The symptoms are not better explained by a primary mental disorder (in particular an Obsessive-compulsive or related disorder), as might be the case if the symptoms preceded the onset of the cocaine use, if the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time after cessation of the cocaine use or withdrawal, or if there is other evidence of a pre-existing primary mental disorder with obsessive-compulsive or related symptoms (e.g., a history of prior episodes not associated with cocaine use)." ;

Panic attacks are discrete episodes of intense fear or apprehension accompanied by the rapid and concurrent onset of several characteristic symptoms (e.g. palpitations or increased heart rate, sweating, trembling, shortness of breath, chest pain, dizziness or lightheadedness, chills, hot flushes, fear of imminent death). In addition, panic disorder is characterised by persistent concern about the recurrence or significance of panic attacks, or behaviours intended to avoid their recurrence, that results in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. The symptoms are not a manifestation of another medical condition and are not due to the effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous system." ;

Even when an adequate primary caregiver is newly available, the child does not turn to the primary caregiver for comfort, support and nurture, rarely displays security-seeking behaviours towards any adult, and does not respond when comfort is offered. Reactive attachment disorder can only be diagnosed in children, and features of the disorder develop within the first 5 years of life.

2. increasing priority given to gaming to the extent that gaming takes precedence over other life interests and daily activities; and 
3. continuation or escalation of gaming despite the occurrence of negative consequences. The behaviour pattern is of sufficient severity to result in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning. 

The pattern of gaming behaviour may be continuous or episodic and recurrent.

A binge eating episode is a distinct period of time during which the individual experiences a subjective loss of control over eating, eating notably more or differently than usual, and feels unable to stop eating or limit the type or amount of food eaten. Binge eating is experienced as very distressing, and is often accompanied by negative emotions such as guilt or disgust. However, unlike in Bulimia Nervosa, binge eating episodes are not regularly followed by inappropriate compensatory behaviours aimed at preventing weight gain (e.g. self-induced vomiting, misuse of laxatives or enemas, strenuous exercise).

A binge eating episode is a distinct period of time during which the individual experiences a subjective loss of control over eating, eating notably more or differently than usual, and feels unable to stop eating or limit the type or amount of food eaten. Binge eating is accompanied by repeated inappropriate compensatory behaviours aimed at preventing weight gain (e.g. self-induced vomiting, misuse of laxatives or enemas, strenuous exercise). The individual is preoccupied with body shape or weight, which strongly influences self-evaluation. There is marked distress about the pattern of binge eating and inappropriate compensatory behaviour or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning. The individual does not meet the diagnostic requirements of Anorexia Nervosa." ;

There is evidence of significant inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity symptoms prior to age 12, typically by early to mid-childhood, though some individuals may first come to clinical attention later. The degree of inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity is outside the limits of normal variation expected for age and level of intellectual functioning. Inattention refers to significant difficulty in sustaining attention to tasks that do not provide a high level of stimulation or frequent rewards, distractibility and problems with organisation. Hyperactivity refers to excessive motor activity and difficulties with remaining still, most evident in structured situations that require behavioural self-control. Impulsivity is a tendency to act in response to immediate stimuli, without deliberation or consideration of the risks and consequences. The relative balance and the specific manifestations of inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive characteristics varies across individuals and may change over the course of development. In order for a diagnosis to be made, manifestations of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity must be evident across multiple situations or settings (e.g., home, school, work, with friends or relatives), but are likely to vary according to the structure and demands of the setting.

In response to their preoccupation, individuals engage in repetitive and excessive behaviours such as repeatedly checking for body odour or checking the perceived source of the smell, or repeatedly seeking reassurance, excessive attempts to camouflage, alter, or prevent the perceived odour, or marked avoidance of social situations or triggers that increase distress about the perceived foul or offensive odour.

The effect of these compounds is distinctly different from smoking naturally cultivated cannabis in that the euphoric effects are typically accompanied or dominated by psychotic-like symptoms (e.g., paranoia, hallucinations, and disorganized behavior). Synthetic Cannabinoid Intoxication may therefore present more frequently with psychotic symptoms in addition to the more typical effects of cannabis.

Examples of opioids include morphine, diacetylmorphine (heroin), fentanyl, pethidine, oxycodone, hydromorphone, methadone, buprenorphine, codeine and d-propoxyphene. The opioids all have analgesic properties of different potencies and are primarily central nervous system depressants. They suppress respiration as well as other vital functions and are a common cause of overdose and related deaths. Certain opioids are used or administered parenterally, including heroin, a common and potent opioid that is primarily used non-medically. Therapeutic opioids are prescribed for a range of indications worldwide, and are essential for pain management in cancer pain and palliative care, although they are also used for non-therapeutic reasons. In some countries morbidity and mortality related to therapeutic opioids is greater than that related to heroin. All opioids may result in Opioid Intoxication, Opioid Dependence and Opioid Withdrawal. A range of Opioid-Induced Disorders occur, some of which occur following Opioid Withdrawal."^^xsd:string ;

Disturbances affect some areas of personality functioning but not others (e.g., problems with self-direction in the absence of problems with stability and coherence of identity or self-worth), and may not be apparent in some contexts. There are problems in many interpersonal relationships and/or in performance of expected occupational and social roles, but some relationships are maintained and/or some roles carried out. Specific manifestations of personality disturbances are generally of mild severity. Mild Personality Disorder is typically not associated with substantial harm to self or others, but may be associated with substantial distress or with impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning that is either limited to circumscribed areas (e.g., romantic relationships; employment) or present in more areas but milder."^^xsd:string ;

However, some areas of personality functioning may be relatively less affected. There are marked problems in most interpersonal relationships and the performance of most expected social and occupational roles is compromised to some degree. Relationships are likely to be characterised by conflict, avoidance, withdrawal, or extreme dependency (e.g., few friendships maintained, persistent conflict in work relationships and consequent occupational problems, romantic relationships characterised by serious disruption or inappropriate submissiveness). Specific manifestations of personality disturbance are generally of moderate severity.

Problems in interpersonal functioning seriously affect virtually all relationships and the ability and willingness to perform expected social and occupational roles is absent or severely compromised.
